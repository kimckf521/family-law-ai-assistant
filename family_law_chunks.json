      "text": "ix PREFACE Welcome to , your online looseleaf family law service in one volume! If you are a lawyer in general practice, a sole practitioner, a family law specialist or a barrister, I am able to identify with you and your needs in the practice of law. The Book first came into being in 1997 as a study book for my family law specialist accreditation exam. In a Lever Arch file, it contained a summary of the cases and legislation set out in the Law Society’s guidelines as required knowledge. Kept up to date with a summary of key new cases as they came through, the Book came into its own as a quick guide to family law, a “workbook”. Its regular disappearance from my room, under the arm of other family lawyers – who even gave it a name – was the first indication of demand for such a work. as it is now, however, with its coverage of both family law and routine procedures and precedents, was really launched 18 months ago when in a survey of the needs of lawyers in general practice – 100 litigation law firms – 91% of them said “bring it on”. A quiz from my business manager (“What would be the ideal product?”) then led to our own website (for links to court forms and brochures and our own advanced precedents) being combined with our looseleaf service in preference to the option of “either or both” that was offered to our survey group. This will put instant drafts of court papers and agreements on your desk to work through with your clients at your leisure, in a fraction of your usual preparation time.

      "text": "x ABOUT OUR LEGAL TEAM Robert Glade-Wright – Founder and former senior editor Rob was born in Somerset, England. He was educated at King’s College, Taunton, and from Year 10 at Devonport High School in Tasmania. Graduating from the University of Tasmania with a Bachelor of Laws in 1972, Rob was articled to Crisp, Wright & Brown – the formidable Sir Reg Wright QC, clerking for him in such jurisdictions as the High Court, and being tutored by his sons Christopher (later a judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania) and Philip (later a magistrate). Rob was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1974 and, including a year in a London law firm, practised in Hobart as a barrister and sole practitioner in general practice until the late 90s when he moved to Queensland as a career change. Although he regularly appeared as counsel (and self-instructing solicitor) in the Family Court of Austra- lia, Rob’s career highlight was actually as counsel in his 20s before the Court of Criminal Appeal where his identification of a misdirection by a trial judge turned a prison visit to advise on an appeal against a seven-year sentence (several months out of time) into a successful appeal against conviction: Richardson v R [1978] TasSR 178. As well as his non-contentious practice in Hobart, Rob was counsel in a range of civil, criminal and family law matters such as for the husband in Gyselman in 1991, a trial on child and property issues that also led to the well-known Full Court appeal on child support. In 1996, he was appointed to Legal Aid’s panel of private lawyers to represent children. Accredited in 1997 as a family law specialist by the Queensland Law Society (for which His Honour Wood SJ was a referee), Rob took a position",

The family later moved to Gympie, then Rockhampton and Brisbane, where he attended Brisbane Boys Grammar School. Craig graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 2001 from Griffith University. Its advanced family law course and his time as a volunteer at the Caxton Legal Centre, giving free legal advice to the community, were the catalyst for his choosing family law as his future profession. He was articled to Gold Coast firm Attwood Marshall and admitted in 2003, working as a family lawyer there until 2005 when he joined Small Myers Hughes at Southport where he became a partner. Craig was a volunteer at the Gold Coast Community Legal Service, giving free legal advice to the com- munity and practical tuition to undergraduates from Bond University. His talents extend to being a volunteer broadcaster at Radio 4EB in Brisbane from 2000 to 2001 for the National Indigenous Radio Service broadcast of “Undercurrents”, canvassing alternative current affairs. Craig also co-wrote two plays which were finalists in Underground Productions’ Short Play Competition in 2003 and 2004, the latter winning the “People’s Choice Award”. In 2015 Craig was accredited as a specialist in family law by the Queensland Law Society, which also awarded Craig the program’s Highest Achiever as “a recognition of his true level of expertise in this area”. Co-editor since the Book’s launch in 2009, Craig took over the reins as editor in 2021.

      "text": "ESSENTIAL RESOURCES 1– 5 ESSENTIAL RESOURCES Make life easier for yourself by entering into a reliable working relationship with competent professionals in the following routine areas of family law practice. An assistant or paralegal Use an assistant or paralegal, or promote a staff member to work as one, to take on much of your time-consuming but uneconomic gathering and processing of information. Introduce them to your clients from Day 1 as being their secondary point of contact (charged at a clerical rate), for matters or concerns not requiring professional assistance. Using a paralegal (or an apprentice, junior lawyer, secretary, receptionist or clerk) in this way will free up your time for your clientele and enable your time to be charged at a proper (professional) rate. Your clients too will appreciate being given the option of much of their work being done at a cheaper rate. By way of staff training, ask your assistant to familiarise themselves with Chapters 1 and 2, the procedural sections of Chapters 3 to 8 and with the operation of our website for the downloading of draft court documents for you to work through with your clients. They should soon be able to handle your firm’s divorce applications and other case management, and download the necessary documents for your other matters. Let them complete the formal details of the Application or Response and Affidavit from the Client Information Sheet completed by the client (“client preliminaries” below), presenting them to you with the draft orders sought and draft affidavit in support. Example – Simply ask them to “put together, from our online ‘forms’ and ‘precedents’ from the relevant chapter(s), a draft Initiating Application (or Response) seeking final property orders (plus routine interim orders); a blank Financial Statement plus the one page addendum sheet attached to the back;",

A family law barrister It is crucial to have an able, reliable family law barrister (and one or two as back-up) who is always available for giving you advice when you need it (at short notice, if necessary), for settling your court papers (which you should be able to email counsel for their prompt attention), or for appearing in court with you and your client. Look into who is available as counsel, ask around. Make appointments with some barristers to see how available and dependable they would be. There may be some trial and error involved, but work towards choosing your primary and back-up counsel, and then use them consistently. Note – Using a family lawyer local to your filing registry who is routinely involved in agency work is an alternative to briefing counsel to appear on your more formal interim applications. Using counsel for ready advice; to settle your court papers; and to appear in court, will add depth and expertise to your family law work and develop the credibility of your practice. A family counsellor (and FDR provider) Go about choosing your primary counsellor and, say, a back-up counsellor in the same way. Seek out someone experienced in family law disputes and family counselling, who is also a registered family dispute resolution (FDR) provider and available at short notice and after normal hours. Being also an FDR provider enables early counselling to be combined with the mandatory pre-action FDR procedures in child matters, including the issue of an",

See “family counselling” and “family dispute resolution” in chapter “children”. A family consultant (report writer) This is the person who will interview your clients’ children, will observe the children’s interaction with their parents, record the children’s views, and then report all that to the court. See “family consultants” in chapter “children”. Family lawyers for opposing parties routinely appoint a family consultant for preparation of such a report. And these reports are usually influential with the court. It is therefore crucial to identify available family consultants (and any particular strengths or leanings they may have), so as to fully inform your choice when either nominating three of them for the selection of a report writer by the other party or choosing from a list of three received from the other party for selection by you.

Again, seek a referral from among your colleagues and, if necessary, do an internet search for a firm that advertises family law work. An experienced operator is likely to prepare the affidavit of service and the acknowledgment of service correctly (even if you send the forms to them blank) and return it to you properly completed, ready for filing in the court registry. Note – Court papers are usually just served on the other party’s lawyer without objection or formality. But whenever personal service is required (such as divorce papers) or service may be controversial (such as an unrepresented party or a lawyer saying they “have no instructions to accept service”, or “are awaiting instructions”), arrange personal service. You will certainly save time and money by getting your papers to your process server to effect personal service without waiting for others to co-operate with you. Avoid postal service, because of the onerous requirements of what has to be filed by way of proof. A forensic accountant Again, ask around among your colleagues (including your barrister) for the name of a good forensic accountant or two, with experience as an expert witness in court, for the valuation of businesses, valuing complex superannuation interests, giving tax advice in your clients’ matters and the investigation of transactions and books of account. Miscellaneous valuers You will benefit from word of mouth recommendations from your colleagues as to registered valuers for different kinds of property, including real estate, complex superannuation interests and such property as motor vehicles, boats, antique furniture and so on.

CONCLUSION Arrange for your assistant to draw up and keep updated and on hand a referrals sheet with a page for each of the above, with their names, addresses and contact details for quick reference. Without such a record, you will find yourself wasting much time attempting to locate an appropriate person each time you need someone from one of those categories. These people and resources are essential capital for the efficient management of the family law aspect of your practice. No longer should it be necessary for any lawyer to say (as one did to the writer [RGW] when he polled 100 law firms as to their interest in a work such as this) “family law is 50% of my practice but it takes 75% of my time”.

Preparation Brief your receptionist, when taking calls from people wanting to speak to you or to “one of your lawyers” with some family law queries: • to say “I’ll see if X is available. I should also mention our ‘initial consultations’ that we offer here for $Y.” (Doing this lets the caller know that that option is available.) • to put such calls through to you. If you are in the middle of something, take the call anyway. Introduce yourself and ask if you may ring them back when you’re free in, say, an hour or whatever time you need. Take their first name and number. The phone inquiry The phone inquiry allows a caller to sound you out, without having to commit to an interview. They may be less interested in your answers than how you speak to them. They may be comparing what you say and how you say it with the responses of other lawyers they have rung. Just be yourself. Be a sympathetic listener, and answer their queries clearly. Ask if reconciliation is out of the question, and say that non-court options such as family counselling and settlement negotiations are usually first steps.

Go through the Client Information Sheet and complete any parts that have been left blank (after your paralegal or assistant has been through it with your client). Receipt their payment. Note – A completed Client Information Sheet will enable your PA to complete most of the parties’, lawyers’ and other case specific details required for the court’s forms, and should also give you a rough idea before you get underway as to what type of case it is going to be. Your next step Go to the relevant chapter for your matter – for its law, procedure and precedents. This is governed by the type of case it is. Matters may be singular, such as divorce, or combined, such as property and spousal maintenance; or child matters with spousal maintenance and property. The 2021 merger of courts changed the venue for court proceedings to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCA) (in Division 1, being the former Family Court of Australia) or Division 2, be- ing the old FCC). The FCWA continues for WA proceedings. For combined matters, much of the procedure will overlap, however it is necessary to check the procedure in each relevant chapter so that no special requirements are overlooked. The procedure for seeking orders in combined proceedings is simple. Simply list all your child orders under “orders sought” in your Application or Response either immediately before or after all the property and/or spousal maintenance orders you are seeking.

Child, spousal maintenance and property combined Follow the procedure for child matters, then the procedure for spousal maintenance, then for property matters. Note – The merger of courts brought with it a shift in how family law cases proceed, with a greater em- phasis on dispute resolution both before and during a proceeding, and new rules to facilitate that shift. These brochures will summarise pre-action procedures for your clients – “Before you file – pre-action procedure for parenting cases” “Before you file – pre-action procedure for financial cases” Before the start of any case you must give your client the FCFCA’s Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management made on 1 September 2021. Costs Each party pays their own costs in family law proceedings in almost all cases: see “costs and security for costs” in the chapter “other routine procedures”. You will see that you are required to give written notice to your client before each court event and upon any offer to settle of their costs to date and future costs. Example – you could summarise in a letter to your client that their costs up to and including the first court hearing (it could be an interim hearing) were, say $5–10,000 (amount paid) with a further, say $8,000 payable up to and including the next court event (conciliation conference). At that second hearing, you could adapt your letter so as to cover costs to date and estimate costs for the final hearing at say $10,000 for a one day trial",

A word about style If you are a lawyer in general practice, you may be accustomed to the adversarial nature of litigation, going hard at your opponent, being awarded costs when you win. Family law is different, being law related to families and their arrangements both financial and as to children after separation. It requires a more subtle, polite approach, even where only financial matters are concerned. You are likely to find that a non-adversarial style will almost always work best in your practice of family law, except when confronted with the most recalcitrant opponent.

      "text": "CHAPTER THREE 3 – 2 JURISDICTION Divorce proceedings may be issued in this country if, at the time of filing, either spouse has Australian citizenship or domicile or been ordinarily resident in Australia for the past year: s 39(3) Family Law Act 1975 (FLA). “Ordinarily resident” includes “habitually resident”: s 4(1) FLA. Also see Russell (No. 5) [2012] FamCA 917 at [9]-[63]. Young J (at [49]) cited House of Lords authority that “habitually” required “residence adopted voluntarily and for [a] settled purpose”. Also see LK v Director-General Department of Community Services [2009] HCA 9 at [27]-[45] The court can decline to exercise jurisdiction where divorce proceedings are pending in another country. In Henry v Henry [1996] HCA 51 the High Court held that its ruling in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 applies to divorce proceedings. The ruling was that a party who has properly issued proceedings in Australia has a prima facie right to have the proceedings determined by an Australian court, unless Australia is the clearly inappropriate jurisdiction. See also Ferrier-Watson v McElrath [2000] FamCA 219. The opinion of a family law specialist or counsel is advisable where assets are held both here and overseas. GROUND OF DIVORCE Divorce is available after 12 months’ separation. The actual ground of divorce is irretrievable breakdown of marriage, established by evidence of the parties having lived separately and apart for a continuous period of 12 months immediately before the filing of the application: s 48(1) and (2) A divorce order will not be made if the court is satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood of cohabita- tion being resumed: s 48(3) RESUMPTION OF COHABITATION Where cohabitation has been resumed on one occasion of less than three months or any other period the court considers “not substantial”",

And see the Full Court in Spanos [1980] FamCA 10 at [22]-[23] (sexual intercourse is a component of a marriage relationship but its occurrence would not alone mean a resumption of cohabitation).

      "text": "DIVORCE 3 – 3 The word “separation” does not mean physical separation, but simply the effective breakdown of the matrimonial relationship: Watson J in Todd (No. 2) (above) at [5] approved by the Full Court in Pavey [1976] FamCA 36 at [7]-[23]: “’Separation’ means more than physical separation – it involves the breakdown of the marital relationship (the consortium vitae). Separation can only occur in the sense used by the Act where one or both of the spouses form the intention to sever or not to resume the marital relationship and act on that intention, or alternatively act as if the marital relationship has been severed. What comprises the marital relationship for each couple will vary. Marriage involves many elements some or all of which may be present in a particular marriage – elements such as dwelling under the same roof, sexual intercourse, mutual society and protection, recognition of the existence of the marriage by both spouses in public and private relationships, and the nurture and support of the children of the marriage.” The Full Court applied that meaning in Falk [1977] FamCA 46 at [21], adding as a requirement the communication of the intention to sever the marital relationship to the meaning of “separation”. The Full Court in Pavey (above) (at [31]) said: “It also seems necessary to comment upon the fact that so often evidence in a case of this kind turns upon cooking, washing and housework…(It) is not possible to apply some mathematical formula to these activities and determine whether a ‘separation’ has occurred. Rather the evidence should examine and contrast the state of the marital relationship before and after the alleged separation.” The Court went on to refer to the requirement of independent corroboration: “The party or parties alleging separation must satisfy the Court about this",

      "text": "and determine whether a ‘separation’ has occurred. Rather the evidence should examine and contrast the state of the marital relationship before and after the alleged separation.” The Court went on to refer to the requirement of independent corroboration: “The party or parties alleging separation must satisfy the Court about this by explaining why the parties continue to live under the one roof, and by showing that there is a change in their relation- ship, gradual or sudden, constituting a separation. For this reason many of the judges of the Family Court of Australia have adopted the practice of requiring corroboration of the applicant’s evidence in cases where parties reside in the same residence. We do not wish to lay down an inflexible rule that evidence from a witness other than the parties to a marriage must be given, but an applicant should always be ready to call such evidence. Whether the judge will require such evidence will depend on the circumstances of each case.” Parties have been held not to have “separated” after the husband left the home as they still acted as a married couple by maintaining a sexual relationship, attending social functions and staying in hotel rooms together and operating a joint bank account: Campbell & Cade [2012] FMCAfam 508. Applying for divorce when under same roof A party wishing to apply for divorce while still living under the same roof with their spouse, instead of the usual option of first separating and then being apart for 12 months, should be advised of the greatly increased costs in proving the case (time spent preparing evidence by affidavit from applicant and corroborating witness(es) and the case being argued – perhaps by counsel – in court), and the risk of losing.

It is sufficient that the arrangements that have been made are the arrange- ments which are, in all the circumstances, the best that could be achieved on the material before me.” EFFECT OF DIVORCE ON WILLS Throughout Australia (except WA) divorce revokes a gift of property or appointment of trusteeship made in a will in favour of a spouse, in the absence of a contrary intention being evident: the Succession Acts of NSW (s 13) and Qld (s 15) and Wills Acts of Vic (s 14), SA (s 20A), Tas (s 20), ACT (s 20A), and NT (s 15). The entire will is revoked in Tasmania (in the absence of a contrary intention or the will being made in contemplation of divorce). On 9 February 2008 WA’s Wills Act was amended to provide that wills are revoked upon divorce orders made after that date in the absence of a contrary intention in the will or other evidence of such intention (s 14A).

They may be issued if the child, a parent or a party to the proceedings is either present or ordinarily resident in Australia or an Australian citizen when the initiating application is filed (s 69E FLA). The Act applies to all children, whether born of or before marriage or of a de facto relationship, and whether adopted, born by artificial conception or under a surrogacy agreement (ss 4, 60F and 69E and, in the case of children of unmarried parents, a referral of State powers to the Commonwealth). Division 2 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCA) is your venue for child-related applications. A case may be transferred to Division 1 of the Court for being complex, suitable for the Magellan List or for any of the other reasons set out in paras 4.8 to 4.13 of the Court’s Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management made 1 September 2021. Note – Before issuing proceedings, both you and your clients are required to follow certain pre-action procedures. These are set out in “family dispute resolution” and “procedure” below. The court can decline to exercise jurisdiction where proceedings are pending in another country. The Full Court dealt with such a case in B & B (Re Jurisdiction) [2003] FamCA 105. The court cited the High Court decision of Henry v Henry [1996] HCA 51, adjourning proceedings in the Family Court of Aus- tralia pending a decision by the District Court of New Zealand (where proceedings were issued after the Australian proceedings were filed).

The High Court applied its decision in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 in which the Court held that a party who has properly issued proceedings in Austra- lia has a prima facie right to have the proceedings determined by an Australian court unless Australia is the clearly inappropriate jurisdiction (the doctrine of forum non conveniens). In ZP v PS [1994] HCA 29 the High Court held that in a custody case involving a foreign element where the child is within the jurisdiction the doctrine of forum non conveniens does not apply and that instead the court must determine what is in the best interests of the child. Jurisdiction of courts of summary jurisdiction State magistrates have federal jurisdiction for Part VII proceedings (s 69J). Matters not by consent (except the Magistrates Court of WA constituted by a Family Law Magistrate of WA) are transferred to the Fed- eral Circuit Court (s 69N).

Lawyers must assist their clients to comply with their duty at all times to act consistently with the main purpose of the rules of court, being the just and timely resolution of disputes at a reasonable cost to the parties: FLR 1.04 (in WA, FCR 5-8). Also see ss 95 and 96 FLA introduced in 2023. You must comply with the lawyers’ obligations set out in clause 6 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 FLR (financial proceedings) and clause 6 of Part 2 (parenting proceedings). In the FCWA see clause 6 of Division 1 of Schedule 1 FCR (financial cases) and clause 12 of Division 2 of that Schedule (parenting cases). You are still required (s 12E FLA; s 65F FCA) to give your clients (when obtaining their instructions, we suggest) the brochure Marriage, families and separation. Explain that it is about the impact of separa- tion, any safety concerns, help lines, counselling, mandatory family dispute resolution, the advantages of reaching agreement, pre-action procedures and the steps involved in court proceedings. By their second appointment we suggest that your clients also receive the brochures Before you file – pre-action procedure for parenting cases (and, if applicable, Before you file – pre-action procedure for financial cases).

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 6 FAMILY COUNSELLING Confidential family counselling is available at any time through the FCFCA’s Counselling Service or private family counsellors to help parents individually or jointly work through personal issues and care arrangements for children (see ss 10B–10E). Most family counsellors are also authorised FDR practitio- ners for the mandatory family dispute resolution stage (see FDR below). A family counsellor may decide whether or not to disclose counselling notes sought under subpoena despite the parties’ consent to disclosure: UnitingCare – Unifam Counselling & Mediation & Harkiss and Anor [2011] FamCAFC 159. Some tips Use an experienced family counsellor, who is a registered FDR provider. Find one in your area by word of mouth or by searching at www.familyrelationships.gov.au here in our eBook. A private counsellor will offer quicker appointments and after-hour times, for joint counselling and an FDR certificate in the one session if necessary. Encourage your clients to make the most of counselling, with as many joint sessions as they like where progress is being made with negotiations (perhaps, even, as to trialling a different arrange- ment of sharing the care of the children before issuing court proceedings). If your client would like counselling on their own initially, or is unwilling to talk to their spouse, refer them to another family counsellor for individual counselling first to talk through feelings that may be blocking their acceptance of the marital breakdown and readiness to discuss arrangements for the children.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 7 FAMILY DISPUTE RESOLUTION Family dispute resolution (FDR) is compulsory, with some exceptions (see below). Parents are required to make a genuine effort to resolve any child-related dispute before issuing proceedings by attending FDR with an FDR practitioner (s 60I) (that’s the capital letter “I”). See ss 10H and 10J as to confidentiality. For an FDR provider near you, search the Family Relationships link under “family counselling” above. A certificate given by the FDR practitioner to your client is to be filed with your application (s 60I(7)) failing which a parenting application may be dismissed (Ellwood & Ravenhill [2019] FamCAFC 153 at [21]-[28]). FDR practitioners (who can double as family counsellors – see “family counselling” above) must comply (s 10K) with the regulations. See Part 7 of the Family Law (Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners) Regula- tions 2008. These cover FDR procedure and include the FDR provider’s discretion to dispense with FDR if satisfied that FDR would be inappropriate because a party is unable to negotiate freely due to their emotional, psychological or physical health; any unequal bargaining power; any history of violence or safety concerns; risk of child abuse; or any other reason. The FDR certificate, under s 60I(8), may certify that FDR: • did not proceed as the other party failed or refused to attend, or • did not proceed as FDR was not considered appropriate as above, or • was attended and the parties made a genuine effort to resolve the issues, or • was attended but either party did not make a genuine effort to resolve the issues. The certificate may also be dispensed with by the court under s 60I(9) for consent orders, pending Part VII proceedings, cases of alleged violence or abuse, serious contravention of an order made within 12 months, urgency",

For sample affidavit, see “precedents” below. Note – Instead of an affidavit and seeking a court order, it is easier in such a case for the applicant to attend FDR on their own to explain the circumstances to the FDR provider, who may issue a certificate on the second ground above (where he or she agrees that the circumstances are such that FDR would be inappropriate). Also note – the 12 month rule. Under Reg 26 of the above regulations an FDR provider must not give and an applicant must not file a certificate more than 12 months after the latest FDR or attempted FDR. Some suggestions If lawyers use FDR providers for certificates to dispense with FDR in cases that are not genuinely inappropriate for FDR, they may find the Act being amended so that only the court may dispense with FDR upon the filing of evidence by the applicant. FDR is a potent opportunity for resolution, and should not be rushed or waived unless a real exception applies. Also note – especially if parties live far from each other or one party fears being in the same room as the other – that telephone FDR is available (via internet search for “telephone dispute resolution” or “telephone mediation”).

This includes an injunction restraining a person from entering or remaining in a place of residence, employment or education of the child or parent. • under s 114(1) FLA (and s 235A FCA) as the court “considers proper”. Such injunctions include: (a) an injunction for the personal protection of a party (b) an injunction restraining a party from entering or remaining in the home or other party’s home, or a specified area that includes either property (c) an injunction restraining a party from entering the place of work of the other party (f) an injunction relating to the use or occupancy of the home Paragraph (d) is not relevant, and paragraph (e) relates to the property of a party to the marriage (covered by “injunctions” in the chapter “property”). A tip – Due to the absence of a clear remedy under the Family Law Act upon a breach of a personal protection injunction we recommend instead that you or the police apply to your local magistrates court for a domestic violence order (upon any contravention of which your client’s complaint to police would lead to the offender being charged with a breach of the order).

The Court held that a personal protection injunction could not be made in favour of a third party; that the third party had her own remedies in trespass; and that the non-communication injunction was “sufficiently broad to preclude the wife from communicating with the husband by physically entering or remaining upon the (new partner’s) premises”: Oates & Crest [2008] FamCAFC 29 at [67] and [71] (despite the husband’s evidence that the “wife’s behaviour in driving past, walking, cycling and coming to the residence of (his new partner) causes great distress to him and to (his new partner)”.

Procedure on arrest Under ss 68C and 114AA a police officer shall bring the arrested person before the court before the due date and the person may be kept in custody if the proceedings have not been completed on the day the arrested person is brought before the court, until the court gives its decision; or orders that the person be released; or adjourns the hearing for more than 24 hours (whichever happens first). Domestic violence orders Separating parties usually find the domestic violence legislation of their State or Territory a quicker option for the protection of themselves and their children than an order from the FCFCA, so that parties will usually come to that court already protected by a domestic violence order, either interim or final.

In most cases of low level partner violence upon a relationship ending, the outbreak is uncharacteristic and unlikely to be repeated once the crisis of the moment (knowing it’s over) is past. In those cases, I recommend crisis counselling in preference to an order as court action can be a blunt instrument that often makes things worse. 2. Where there is a fear of repetition of harassment, but no history of violence or other worrying conduct, then protection orders have their place in keeping people safe. Partners in this category are usually deterred from further misbehaviour. 3. In a small minority of cases the partner is so unpredictable that a protection order is not going to help, so other methods should be discussed with your counsellor and family lawyer. Lawyers will rightly be cautious when dealing with a client’s risky partner but will still often find them manageable through appropriate means including counselling and other non-adversarial strategies.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 10 SOLE OCCUPANCY Sole occupancy is not easy to obtain. The court may “as it considers proper” grant “an injunction relat- ing to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home”: s 114(1)(f). The section applies to de facto partners as to the “use or occupancy of a specified residence of the parties” and restraint of a party from entering or remaining in that residence or specified area in which it is situated: s 114(2A). As to the court’s approach, the Full Court in Davis [1982] FamCA 73 at [10] cited with approval the fol- lowing passage from Lindenmayer J in an unreported judgment of Price delivered 12 July 1982: “…[I]t is no longer necessary that such an applicant show that it is impossible or intolerable for him or her to continue in co-occupation of the house with the other party, or that there has been some conduct by the other party which justifies his exclusion from the home. All that is necessary, it seems, is that the Court should regard the situation between the parties as being such that it would not be reasonable or sensible or practicable to expect them to continue to remain in the home together.” In Priddle [2009] FMCAfam 258 at [30]-[39] Brown FM cited Davis in which it was said that the fac- tors relevant to whether sole occupancy was “proper” included the means and needs of the parties; the needs of any children; hardship to either party or children; and, if relevant, conduct justifying one party being expelled from the home. Inconvenience was said not to be a factor and the court should “be alive to the risk that a spouse may use a sole occupancy injunction as a tactical weapon in any ongoing matrimonial conflict”.

Inconvenience was said not to be a factor and the court should “be alive to the risk that a spouse may use a sole occupancy injunction as a tactical weapon in any ongoing matrimonial conflict”. H’s alcoholism, violence and abuse towards W was found to be harming an older child in O’Dea [1980] FamCA 23. It was held that the children’s needs were such that they and W should remain in the home; that W could not be adequately housed elsewhere; and that there would be less hardship on H if he were to leave. The balance of convenience may decide the case: Kale & Karmel [2012] FamCA 851 at [17]. For a review of relevant matters, see Kimberley [2011] FamCA 406 at [39]-[61]. Conflict Conflict that is harming a party or children may tip the balance in favour of an applicant for sole and exclusive use and occupation in a close case (e.g. Grenfell and Ors [2010] FamCA 1078 at [79]-[81]). In cases of significant conflict we suggest your client apply for an interim order for sole occupancy until the final hearing. Email your barrister a full statement of your instructions as to events between the parties – especially conflict – with a brief to advise on the adequacy of those facts for a sole occupancy injunction, and as to the form of the injunction if one is recommended. In Rainsford [2010] FMCAfam 231 at [37]-[68] W failed to discharge the onus of proving that she needed sole occupancy. See Ledarn [2010] FamCA 1107 as to sole occupancy of business premises.

Parenting plan Parenting plans are not recommended, mainly because they cannot be enforced as an order can (except indirectly via an application for a parenting order under s 65C as to which the court must have regard to the terms of any parenting plan “if doing so would be in the best interests of the child” under s 65DAB). An Application for Consent Orders is the way to go, and the cost is about the same.

(2) To avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.” Note – Where there is an order for joint decision-making, the Family Law Amendment Act 2023 only obliges consultation and a genuine effort to agree as to long-term decisions. There is no longer a requirement that the decision be made jointly (as s 65DAC was repealed). Arguments for joint decision-making on major long-term issues Note – While cases heard between 2006 and 2023 that ruled in favour of a statutory presumption of equal shared parental responsibility that has been repealed, they are nonetheless arguable in sup- port of a case for joint decision-making on major long-term issues under the Family Law Amendment Act 2023, not as factual comparisons but by reference to the type of evidence which led those courts to hold that such decisions should be jointly made.

In N & M [2006] FamCA 958 M was given sole decision-making where F, who had been violent but not since separation, was unreliable, failed to cooperate about the children and undermined their relation- ship with M. In R & R [2007] FMCAfam 29 at [84], [86], [91] and [109]–[115] Brown FM made the same order, finding in the face of contested allegations of violence against F that there was “a significant level of dysfunction in the parental relationship” and that the court had “considerable reservations about whether the parties [were] likely to be able to engage in such a consultative and consensual decision- making process about their children”. In Penski & Kocher [2013] FamCA 255 at [71]–[73] an order that M have sole responsibility was preferred to F’s proposed division of responsibilities. In Grant & Terry [2008] FMCAfam 694, sole responsibility was given to M where F was a bully; and in Mashman & Lockwood [2009] FMCAfam 1171 at [47], [69]–[72], where, due to M’s regular abuse of alcohol and nitrazepam, “it would simply be dangerous for the child for M to be left in charge”.

Note – This will mean that the person with whom the child is spending time will usually not need to consult on decisions about such things as what the child eats or wears because these are usually not major long-term issues. (2) Subsection (1) applies subject to any provision to the contrary made by a parenting order.” In VR & RR [2002] FamCA 320 at [28]-[30] the Full Court said that the court will not interfere with how a parent sees fit to care for a child in their care under an order unless “the welfare of the child will be clearly advanced” by doing so (M unsuccessfully took issue with F’s arrangements while the children",

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 20 EQUAL TIME OR UNEQUAL TIME Note – The concept of equal time was introduced to the Act in 2006 but repealed by the Family Law Amendment Act 2023. Equal time will nevertheless continue to be the care arrangement of choice for many parents and may still be an arrangement imposed by the court under existing interim or final orders. See our archived children’s case notes under “equal time” for cases in which it was found that either an equal or unequal time arrangement would be in the best interests of the children. Research findings In a presentation to Queensland’s Family Law Residential on 15 August 2008, a leading social scien- tist, Dr Bruce Smyth, referred to preliminary analysis of trends since the introduction of shared care as pointing to 53% of shared care arrangements in the general population ending within 12 months. He argued that shared care can work really well for some families, but badly for others, especially those marked by high conflict. In the writer’s view [RGW], equal care is not something our clients should be aspiring to because, like Everest, “it’s there”. We should ensure that clients seeking equal care are, in the interests of the children, being realistic as to the long-term feasibility of their proposal. Arguments in favour of equal time In Astor [2007] FamCA 355 O’Reilly J concluded that the children’s best interests would be served by an order that they spend equal time with each parent and did so ([195]) after “carefully considering” two pre-2006 decisions. Her Honour said at [104]-[106]: “[Mr Jordan of counsel for the father] referred to the decision of the Chief Justice (then Chief Federal Magistrate Bryant) in C & O’N [2003] FMCAfam 154 as authority for the proposition that, despite differences between parties,",

In that case, it was determined that the children’s best interests would be served by week about equal time (7pm Sunday to 7pm Sunday) despite the circumstances that there had been verbal and physical altercations between the parties (par 22); resentment in one of the parties (par 22); and inclusion in the family report of the observation that ‘one of the difficulties with shared care is that usually for shared care to work in the children’s best interests it is necessary for the parties to co-operate and facilitate this arrangement’ (par 32). However, taking into account all relevant factors, and in particular ‘the children’s excellent relationship with both parents and desire to have both parents playing an important role in their lives’, Her Honour concluded on balance in favour of an equal time shared care regime. See the reasons at par 62-67. Mr Jordan (as was appropriate) did not seek to make any factual comparison between that deci- sion and the present case, but rather referred to it as showing that cooperation and communi- cation difficulties do not always lead to the result that equal time will not be ordered if for other good reason equal time is found to be in the children’s best interests.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 21 ‘The factors that the court should particularly examine in cases where a party seeks orders that share a child’s time equally between its parents (or others) include the following: • The parties’ capacity to communicate on matters relevant to the child’s welfare. • The physical proximity of the two households. • Are the homes sufficiently proximate that the child can maintain their friendships in both homes? • The prior history of caring for the child. Have the parties demonstrated that they can implement a 50/50 living arrangement without undermining the child’s adjustment? • Whether the parties agree or disagree on matters relevant to the child’s day to day life. For example, methods of discipline, attitudes to homework, health and dental care, diet and sleeping pattern. • Where they disagree on these matters the likelihood that they would be able to reach a reasonable compromise. • Do they share similar ambitions for the child? For example, religious adherence, cultural identity and extra-curricular activities. • Can they address on a continuing basis the practical considerations that arise when a child lives in 2 homes? If the child leaves necessary school work or equipment at the other home will the parents readily rectify the problem? • Whether or not the parties respect the other party as a parent. • The child’s wishes and the factors that influence those wishes. • Where siblings live.’ O’Reilly J’s conclusion as to best interests is at [192]-[193], the order for equal time being found ([196]-[200) to be “reasonably practicable”.

In Biss [2009] FamCA 1234 at [214] O’Reilly J concluded that “having considered the positive and neg- ative factors as to whether equal time is in the children’s best interests, I have determined firmly that it is”. A positive factor in that case ([179]) was the fact that an equal time arrangement had been “successfully implemented” by the parties for 10 months, O’Reilly J saying: “ … [W]hilst it is true that the case authorities and other literature traditionally have not favoured equal time arrangements where parties have a lack of communication, I would refer again to my observation during the trial of genuine willingness by each to address this matter. There is good reason to think … that as time goes on and the parties’ mutual bitterness recedes their communi- cation skills in relation to the children will improve, as each gets on with his and her separate life.” In Reddin & Bickett [2022] FedCFamC1F 910 Kari J said at [193]: “While these matters [at [204] the parents’ ‘toxic relationship and a mutual disrespect for each other’] appear to contra indicate these parents being able to effectively co-parent in any way moving forward, I am conscious that both parents spoke of a willingness and desire to co-parent into the future. … ” Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

What is inescapable however, is: (a) That both parents have contributed to the current state of affairs; and (b) That these children, if permitted by each of their parents, derive significant benefit from the relationship that they have with each of their parents.” In Rappel [2010] FamCA 280 at [173] Murphy J concluded: “On balance, I consider that K should have the benefit of such parenting as each of her parents are able to provide by spending equal amounts of time with each parent.” In Banning & Wylie [2009] FMCAfam 1049 Lapthorn FM made an order that F’s time be increased incrementally towards equal time once the child (aged 3 years and 10 months) began school. The Court (at [62]) disagreed with the family consultant’s view that the parties were unable to “cooperate and be respectful in their parenting relationship”.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 24 RESEARCH STUDIES Different kinds of “time” Altobelli FM in M & K [2007] FMCAfam 918 at [14], under the heading “significance of time”, referred to a 2005 paper by leading Australian researcher, Bruce Smyth, “Time to Rethink Time?”, which found that: “…the greater the range of context for interaction between parents and their children, the better (for)…children’s social, emotional and cognitive development…(and for) opportunities for parents to build emotional bonds with their children”. The court went on to refer to the paper’s reference to the importance of a mix of activities and experiences of time forming the hub of family life, such as overnight, one-on-one together, out- door, fun or special and, in particular, “being-in-the-moment” time. The court referred to (the now repealed) s 65DAA(3) as the Act’s attempt to incorporate this social science perspective into law. The wide variety of activities and time experiences described at [14] of the judgment should help your clients set out in their affidavits their own case for the benefit to the children of having a relationship with your client (s 60CC(2)(e)). Options for parental care have been identified from research by Bruce Smyth (above) and Richard Chisholm (former judge of the Family Court of Australia), “Exploring options for parental care of children following sepa- ration: A primer for family law specialists” (2006) 20 Australian Journal of Family Law 193”, which included the following conclusions: • “The alternating weekend pattern…simply assigned mothers all the work of raising children, including discipline, homework, and child care, and…excluded fathers from these normal parenting responsibilities and opportunities” (US researcher, Joan Kelly at p 197). • Although fathers, in particular, are now seeking and being granted more time, through longer weekends, more midweek time, and time with children at an earlier age than was",

Some patterns of care can look horrendous on paper but can work well when children’s activities are the pivot points around which changeovers and care arrangements occur” (p 201). • A block of 3-4 nights a fortnight from Thursday or Friday night to Monday morning before school, with some midweek time built around the children’s after-school activities (taking them, being there, then sharing a meal, taking them home) is emerging as a means of greater involvement by dads with their children, with minimal disruption to the school week (also, respite for the primary carer). One or two nights precede a school day (Thursday being the least disruptive for overnight care as it winds down to the last day of the school week), so dad is involved not just in “fun time” but during the children’s midweek routine, e.g. by being around more, preparing school lunches, homework help, bedtime and the morning ritual of getting the children off to school (p 205).

Many developmental psychologists view such arrangements as not suiting some children, including young children and those caught in the middle of high levels of conflict (pp 199 and 207). • “Most (research) models emphasise the importance of stability and predictability for infants (0–18 months) and young children (18 months–3 years) – including daily time with each parent where possible, a predictable eating and sleeping routine, and limited overnight stays with the (other) parent until children are older – although there is… debate and little data about when overnights should start” (p 212). (Cited research on this included T Altobelli’s paper, “Rethinking contact arrangements involving young children” (2005) 19 AJFL 29–43.) • Where there is high and continuing parental conflict, spending time with an abusive parent may be highly inappropriate, with serious, long-lasting adverse effects on children (pp 200 and 211). • Blocks of time with an after-school pick-up and before school drop-off reduces the opportunity for parental conflict (Kelly at p 206). • A lengthy discussion of age-based parenting plans by US researcher Dr Robert E Emery in his book “Two Homes, One Childhood”. • “Parents need to be encouraged to think more laterally about what arrangements might work best for their children and themselves.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 26 THE COURT’S APPROACH TO INTERIM HEARINGS Interim hearings proceed “on the papers” (the filed application and affidavits in support are tendered and submissions made), instead of oral evidence being taken and the parties and their witnesses cross- examined as occurs at the final hearing. The Full Court’s decision of Goode [2006] FamCA 1346 will no longer be good law, given that it was decided on sections of the Act introduced in 2006 to create the concept of equal time, which from 6 May 2024 have been repealed. Goode does contain at [66]-[71] a discussion of Cowling [1998] FamCA 19, a decision of the Full Court decided before the 2006 amendment of the Family Law Act, at a time when “it was left to case law to formulate the methodology to be adopted in interim applications” ([66]). The repeal of the law on which Goode was decided effectively reinstates the authority of Cowling as to the courts’ approach to interim hearings. Applying previous authority ([15]) as to that approach as “still relevant”, the Full Court in Cowling said at [18]: “( … ) The issue for determination at an interim hearing involves a consideration of what orders should be made to properly regulate the position of the children pending the final determination of the matter. Such proceedings are an abridged process where the scope of the inquiry is necessarily significantly curtailed. As a consequence, the Court needs to exercise considerable caution against being drawn into matters properly dealt with in the trial process. Ordinarily, at interim hearings, the Court should not be drawn into issues of fact or matters relating to the merits of the substantive cases of each of the parties. Accordingly, in determining what orders should be made, the Court traditionally looks to the",

Ordinarily, at interim hearings, the Court should not be drawn into issues of fact or matters relating to the merits of the substantive cases of each of the parties. Accordingly, in determining what orders should be made, the Court traditionally looks to the less contentious matters, such as the agreed facts, the care arrangements prior to separation, the current circumstances of the parties and their children and the parties’ respective proposals for the future. In some cases, it may also be necessary to consider child protection issues.” The Court then ([19]-[25]) summarised the relevant criteria for determining interim proceedings: 1. “The best interests of the child” are “paramount” (s 60CA). 2. “Those interests will normally be best met by ensuring stability in the life of the child pending a full hearing.” 3. “Where the evidence clearly establishes that … the child is living in an environment in which he or she is well settled, the child’s stability will usually be promoted by the making of an order which provides for the continuation of that arrangement until the hearing for final orders, unless there are strong or overriding indications relevant to the child’s welfare to the contrary … [e.g.] convincing proof that the child’s welfare would be really endangered by his/her remaining in that environment.” 4. “In determining what weight to place upon [the importance of retaining the child’s current living arrangements] … the Court [should] take account of the circumstances giving rise to the current status quo. In particular: • whether the current circumstances have arisen by virtue of some agreement between the parties or as a result of acquiescence. • whether the current arrangements have been unilaterally imposed. • the duration of the current arrangements and … any undue delay in instituting",

In Hendrickson & Murrell (No. 3) [2012] FamCA 1010 an interim order was made suspending a par- ent’s time with a child but in doing so the court was able to rely not on the evidence of the other parent but a psychiatric report. In Sebastian (No. 3) [2012] FamCA 707 an interim order was made that M install an alcohol monitoring system in her home and undertake a breath test before driving the children. M claimed she had abstained for 14 months but did not deny her past excessive drinking. The Full Court in Marvel (No. 2) [2010] FamCAFC 101 at [123] cited this statement of Boland and Thackray JJ in SS & AH [2010] FamCAFC 13 at [100]: “The intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater impor- tance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time con- straints prevent the evidence being tested. Apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. It is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.” In Salah [2016] FamCAFC 100 the Full Court at [59]-[63] held that the trial judge should have given weight to F’s “without admissions” consent to superv ision as being a concession by him that supervision was in the best interests of the children.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 29 STRATEGIES FOR CHILD TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH PARENTS • Be aware that a party will often have to work through unresolved personal feelings about the relationship breakdown before they are ready to discuss arrangements for the children. Arrange for such a party to see their own counsellor first, before joint counselling begins. • Lawyers should keep a low profile until the parties have been through the gentler medium of counselling – where negotiated gains are more likely – and then follow up on arrangements discussed or agreed to at counselling. • Let your client know at the outset that the purpose of the Family Law Act, except in genuine cases of violence or child abuse, is to see that children have the benefit of a relationship with both parents and other significant people. • Trialling a parenting arrangement before taking action is preferable and more likely to be what the family wants than a timetable imposed by the court. • Consider how to meet the needs of any child under 3 with a primary attachment, usually to the mother (but see “overnight contact for young children” under “research studies” above). • As to whether (or not) to advise a client to obtain a domestic violence order, see “domestic violence orders” under “interim injunctions” above. • Where family violence or child abuse, drug or alcohol use or mental ill health is alleged, advise your client to consider at an early stage strategies for mitigating risk to child and bettering the parent’s case if litigation is required. This may include attendance at a “parenting after separation” or behavioural change course, engaging with a counsellor or psychologist for regular treatment and an undertaking, or volunteering to undertake urine or hair follicle testing.

Procedure for allegations of abuse or family violence A Notice of child abuse, family violence or risk is to be filed with all applications and responses seeking parenting orders whether risk is alleged or not: FLR 2.04(1). In WA a Form 4 is filed only if such allegations are made. An affidavit must also be filed as to the evidence on which any allegation is based: FLR 2.04(2). The court must notify a prescribed child welfare authority (s 67Z(3)) and take prompt action as set out in s 67ZBB. A new Notice (with affidavit) must be filed if further child abuse, family violence or risk is alleged to have arisen since the first Notice was filed: FLR 2.06. An applicant must also file a copy of any relevant family violence order: FLR 2.10.

The risk of child sexual abuse is not unacceptable if the possible abuser’s time is limited to day time and supervised: Giordano & Sica [2012] FamCA 64 at [97]-[101]. In Tate & Ralph [2012] FMCAfam 279 at [118]-[139] the court found an unacceptable risk and ordered no time due to the lack of suitable supervisors. A commercial supervisory agency was preferred to F’s fiancée in Joelson [2014] FamCA 788 (but see Canfeld & Falkins [2020] FCCA 2570 where M could no longer afford professional supervision). An indefinite supervision order should usually include liberty to apply for unsupervised time: Slater & Light [2013] FamCAFC 4 at [69]-[70]. The Full Court said in C & J [1996] FamCA 86 at [97] that supervision can both comfort M and protect F against further allegations of abuse. In Green & Graham [2011] FamCAFC 248 a non-supervision interim order was reversed (in a non-abuse case) as reassurance to M where F had a history of non-contact. In Gong & Wei [2017] FamCAFC 55 an interim supervision order was set aside where F adduced positive notes from his supervisor.

While the Family Law Act, as amended in 2023, no longer provides for the court to consider “any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views”, the courts will no doubt do so anyway (as they did in the following case law). In a review of studies of children after separation, Nicholson CJ in ZN & YH [2002] FamCA 453 at [113] referred to this finding of the Children’s Issues Centre at the University of Otago in 1997: “One of the most important conclusions to be drawn from our study is that children do have views about their lives after parental separation and…are highly capable of expressing their views. Even children as young as five…can talk about their feelings and what situations mean to them despite the complexity of the experiences…(The) view that children’s capacities to understand and partici- pate have been underestimated is reinforced for us by this study.” Nicholson CJ took the unusual course of a chambers meeting with the children – aged 14, 12 and 9 – at their request, the outcome of which was that the children expressed a wish opposite to that in evidence from the report writer. Hannon J’s view in Doyle [1992] FamCA 88 that weight should be given to wishes “soundly based”, “founded upon proper considerations” and “well thought through” was approved by the Full Court in R & R: Children’s Wishes [2000] FamCA 43 (which held that a court must carefully consider, but is not bound by, a child’s views).

There, the report writer felt that the reasons for the children wanting to live with their father stemmed from their lack of contact when he was overseas and wish to spend more time with him. The father’s limited insight into the children’s needs was also considered relevant. In H & W [1995] FamCA 30 at [58] the Full Court said: “... [I]n the face of conflicting evidence…the Court will attach varying degrees of weight to a child’s stated wishes depending upon, amongst other factors [arguably any overt acts (e.g. run- ning away) or parental manipulation of a child’s views], the strength and duration of those wishes, their basis, and the maturity of the child, including the degree of appreciation by the child of the factors involved in the issue before the court and their longer term implications.” Faced with children of 6 and 8 said to be “pining” for their mother who had moved from Hobart to Launceston, the Full Court in K & Z [1997] FamCA 56 at [7.9] said: “( ... ) If both parents offer reasonable homes for a child with comparable standards of excellent child care, then the child’s level of contentment and happiness in one household as compared with that in the other must become a most significant, and almost determinate factor in deciding with which parent the child should live.

They suggest that different contexts facilitate children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, as well as afford greater opportunities for parents to build emotional bonds with their children.” Young children The High Court in Gronow [1979] HCA 63 upheld the first instance decision of Evatt CJ giving custody of a 4 year old child to the father. Both parents worked full-time and were suitable carers. The High Court held that it should not be an inflexible rule in custody cases that a young daughter was best left with the mother. All judges commented on changing social conditions and family life with the advent of “working mothers”.

When [family consultant] Ms BB was asked whether either party had demonstrated an insight as to whether their ‘toxic’ relationship had any impact on the children, Ms BB said that she had noted some parental incapacity on the part of both of the parties and that, while the parties may have been aware of it, they did not seem to be able to prioritise the children over their angry feelings about each other.” Such parental incapacity may be not mutual but unilateral, as in a case of alienation, an example of which is Goldman (No. 2) [2017] FamCA 531. In that case Cleary J reversed the care of children from M to F, saying at [310]: “Overall, I formed the impression that the mother … has been almost entirely focused … on punishing [the father] … and on turning the children’s affections away from him. She has caused emotional harm to the children and represents an unacceptable risk to the children of such harm continuing.” A mother lost her share of responsibility for and time with her child due to a “personality disorder that impaired her",

The right to know and be cared for by both parents and the right of contact on a regular basis with both parents are said to be principles underlying the objects of Pt VII of the Act [Ed – His Honour’s foot- note here cites s 60B(2)(a) and (b).

Smyth refers to the notion of time as part and parcel of the ‘custody wars’ between parents. He says about time at page 4: ‘ ... Parents fight about it, courts divvy it up, and children long for it.’ Smyth goes on to say some important things about time at page 9 of the article: • A solid body of data also suggest that it is the quality of relationships between parents, and between parents and children, that exerts a critical influence on children’s wellbeing, not the amount of time per se (Amato and Gilbreth 1999; Pryor and Rodgers 2001). Of course, an emotionally close and warm relationship between parents and children requires time to sustain it. ‘Quality time’ needs time. • According to Kelly and Lamb (2000), the greater the range of contexts for interaction between parents and their children, the better. They suggest that different contexts facilitate children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, as well as afford greater opportunities for parents to build emotional bonds with their children. • It is the intermingling of different activities and the different experiences of time that diverse contexts bring that form the hub of family life, and which are critical for family wellbeing. For instance, overnight stays allow for the experience of mundane everyday routines, as well as special moments – such as putting children to bed, reading to them, saying good night, and starting the day together over breakfast. Focused one-on-one together time (such as playing a game, talking in the car, reading a book together, or helping with homework) sends a clear signal to children that they matter.

Care was reversed in such a case in Irish & Michelle [2009] FamCA 66 and McDermott & Bond [2009] FamCA 1161. An innocent parent’s time was increased in Hacker [2009] FMCAfam 217.

Separation of siblings The Full Court held in Hayman [1976] FamCA 98 that the trial judge placed too much emphasis on reuniting young siblings who were strangers to one another, and not enough on the loving extended family and stable environment the child was enjoying at the time of the hearing. But see Doyle under “sexual orientation” below (siblings not to be separated except in special or exceptional circumstances, such as in Patrick [2009] FMCAfam 326 where a 13 year old was allowed her wish to live with the father despite separation from her siblings aged 12 and 10).

In Macri [2010] FMCAfam 662 a father was allowed to defer formal entry into the Jewish faith by children of 8 and 10. Where the youngest child was with the mother who had become a Jehovah’s Witness and the father had the two eldest children with him and his new partner, the court did consider the narrowness of the moth- er’s environment but awarded custody to the father because of doubt that the mother would encourage close contact between the child and the child’s father and siblings: Paisio [1978] FamCA 82.

In Whitton and Anor (No. 2) [2010] Fam CA 1119 the best interests of the children were held to be paramount, not the mother’s freedom to choose a school near where she might decide to live. In Hamill [2009] FamCA 1324 at [19] Faulks DCJ granted a mother sole responsibility (previously equally shared) to resolve a choice of school dispute. In Dreyfus & Kearney [2010] FamCA 1054 a child was allowed to choose from two schools nominated by the mother. In Bardot & Benjamin [2013] FCCA 1024 a bullied child was allowed to change schools. In Bilz & Breugelman [2013] FamCA 578 a public school was preferred to a Christian school as child was “immersed in religion” ([90]).

The other person is objecting to the issue of a passport; ii. There are court orders restraining the child’s travel, such as an airport watch-list order; or iii. There is another good reason why the administrative process would not provide an appropriate remedy; or iv. The administrative process has resulted in a refusal to issue a passport. c) Where application is made to the court the supporting material ought to set out why the ad- ministrative process is unsuitable and provide appropriate evidence. Applications need to also address the relevant factors under Part VII of the Family Law Act. d) Applications to the court must be served upon the other parent (or person with parental responsibility) unless orders are obtained for substituted service or, in the exceptional case, that service be dispensed with.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 48 CHANGE OF CHILD’S NAME The Full Court held in Chapman & Palmer [1978] FamCA 86 at [56]-[57] that a court will not prevent a parent from changing a child’s surname (or direct that a changed name be restored) unless it is satisfied that the change was made without the consent of the other parent and does not promote the welfare of the child. The child’s welfare (now “best interests”) stands above the parents’ wishes. Relevant factors: • Welfare (now, best interests) of child • Effect on child’s relationship with their father • Confusion of identity • Embarrassment if name is different from mother’s • Short- and long-term effects of name change • Effect of frequent or random changes of name The mother was restrained from using a new surname for the children due to the father’s continuing contact with them. Connor J (of the FCWA) in Beach & Semmler [1979] FamCA 1 added: • Short- and long-term advantages to child of no change of name • Extent of contact (now, time) with father (past and future) • Extent to which child identifies with father • Extent to which child identifies with mother and her new partner • Degree of identification with a child to be born to mother and new partner • The desire of the father that his name be restored The mere registration of the child’s name does not act as an estoppel against considering what is in the child’s best interests: Mahony & Mckenzie [1993] FamCA 78. A name change was not allowed where the father was in continuing contact with the child (Skrabl & Leach [1989] FamCA 67) and allowed where the father had had little contact with the child (Re Skipworth [1989] FamCA 72).

See also Flanagan & Handcock [2000] FamCA 150. A hyphenated surname has been approved as a compromise (Mahony & Mckenzie (above)) and the father’s surname preferred to a hyphenated surname (Fooks & McCarthy [1993] FamCA 117). In Fooks Warnick J held that the child’s best interests stood above a parent’s wishes; the child identified with the father’s surname; and a change of name was likely to lead to the child being exposed to the father’s resentment and increased animosity between the parties.

There is no such provision in the Qld Act, which (s 17) only allows joint applications however the following suggested wording of the order should apply in Qld too. The order made in Mahony & Mckenzie (above) was (1) that the husband and wife: (i) henceforth exclusively use the name “Mckenzie-Mahony” as the surname of the child of the marriage Jake Eliot, formerly known as Mahony and also known as Mckenzie; (ii) forthwith do all things necessary, individually and jointly including making application and executing documents, to seek the alteration of the registration of the name of the said child in the register of births in the State of Queensland from the surname “Mahony” to",

See s 61DAA and the definition of “major long-term issues” in s 4(1).

Much of that difficulty stems from the fact that to take a child from the place where one of the parents lives (and, in some cases, works) to some distant place will, if the other parent does not move, necessarily affect the way in which the child’s relationship with that other parent can be maintained and allowed to develop. It follows that the needs and the wishes of each parent and the needs of the child (and, if of sufficient age, the child’s wishes) all bear upon the question to be considered by the Family Court. In the end, as the … Act … makes plain [Ed – The footnote here that cites s 65E should now be read as s 60CA], the Fam- ily Court ‘must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration’, but that does not deny the fact that there are at least three persons who will be affected by the order that is made: two adults and the child. And very often, of course, there will be other relatives of the child whose contact with the child will be curtailed if the child lives in one place rather than another. In these circumstances, it would be quite wrong to treat the decision that is to be made as confined to a choice between whatever may be the particular ‘proposals’ that the parents may make for the residence of, and",

There may have been some … compelling reason for the parties to make that assumption and to conduct the litigation on this premise. But neither the premise nor the reasons for adopting it were explored in evi- dence or in argument in the courts below and therefore these matters could not be tested or examined in this Court. The premise is not one which, in relocation cases, should be accepted as a matter of course. When one parent … wishes a child who is, or is to be, resident with that parent to move to a place distant from the other parent, it should not be assumed that that other parent cannot, or should not, contemplate moving to be near the child. There may be … compelling reason for that other parent … not to move, but it would ordinarily be expected that these reasons would be explored in evidence and the validity of any assumption that the other parent will not move would be examined. Just as, in this case, the mother was asked what she would do, if she could not have the child reside with her in India, so too it might have been expected that the father would be asked what he would do, if the mother were to have the child reside with her in India.

Such questions should not be treated as mere forensic tests of parental devotion, to which only one answer is seen as being satisfactory proof of being a loving parent. Rather, they are no more than a prelude to a deeper inquiry about where the best interests of the child may lie and what arrangements will best serve those interests. It is now recognised as self-evidently true that, apart from some cases of abusive relationships, children benefit from the development of good relationships with both their parents. The right to know and be cared for by both parents and the right of contact on a regular basis with both parents are said to be principles underlying the objects of Pt VII of the Act [Ed – His Honour’s footnote here cites s 60B(2) (a) and (b). While the Family Law Amendment Act 2023 repealed those provisions they did contain s 60CC(2)(e) which acknowledged ‘the benefit to the child of being able to have a relationship with the child’s parents’.] If effect is to be given to those principles, it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in a place of his choosing. It is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of the parents, let alone the interests of one of them.” Other relocation cases In AMS v AIF [1999] HCA 26, Hayne J (a",

But that is not the proper focus of inquiry. The proper focus is which is better for the child – to be in the custody of the father (in Perth) or to be in the custody of the mother (in Darwin). That, of course, requires attention to what benefits will the child have, and what detriments will the child suffer, from being in the mother’s custody in Darwin. If the mother had wished to move to marry and establish a new family in Darwin, or to take up new and better employment or training in Darwin, it may well have been possible to conclude that in all the circumstances the child’s welfare would be advanced by his being committed to the mother’s custody. The circumstances to be considered would include not only the fact of relocation but also all of the consequences that would follow – separation from the non-custodial parent, the creation of a new family in which the child would thereafter live (with all the concomitant advantages and disadvantages), the better economic posi- tion of the custodial parent, and so on. In that sense, inquiring about why the mother wished to move was relevant but it was only one inquiry among the many that go into deciding the ultimate question.

In Morgan & Miles [2007] FamCA 1230 Boland J upheld Brewster FM’s interim order for the mother to return a child after she had moved 144 km away before the interim hearing. Boland J analysed the issue of relocation at [58]-[61] and [72]-[74], interim relocation at [83] (which cites Cowling, which we deal with under “the court’s approach to interim hearings”) and local v interstate v overseas relocation at [89]-[91], saying at [88]: “ … [T]he very difficult issues in cases involving a relocation ( … ) make it highly desirable that, except in cases of emergency, the arrangements which will be in the child’s best interests should not be determined in an abridged interim hearing, and these are the type of cases in which the child’s present stability may be extremely relevant on an interim basis. It further appears to me the comments of Warnick J in C and S remain apt and relevant to determination of these cases.” In C & S [1998] FamCA 66 Warnick J (expressing the Full Court’s view) said: “ … [I]t is clear that the interests of any child … are very much connected with any questions directly affecting (the child), such as a relocation, being determined by a court without the im- pediment of a situation of recent development, which … significantly alters the relationship … or circumstances of the child with regard to one of its parents from what it or they had been immedi- ately",

In Chapa [2012] FMCAfam 1420 an anxious mother (M) with no home support who alleged child abuse and family violence by F was not sent back where F’s own case supported hers. Interim relocation was allowed in Robson & Johns [2008] FMCAfam 721 given the “short period [7 months] before the final hearing” (M soon to give birth; allegedly angry F granted fortnightly time at a contact centre); in Pace & Wilson [2009] FMCAfam 367 (a 5-year-old had not seen F for 3 years); and in Franklyn [2019] FamCAFC 256 at [29] (the move did not prevent M from adhering to order for child to see F once a fortnight). But in Silas & Barry [2009] FMCAfam 448 M was ordered to return and injoined from changing a child’s name.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 55 COURT SANCTION OF SPECIAL MEDICAL PROCEDURES Sterilisation The High Court in Marion’s case (Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB) [1992] HCA 15 held that a decision to authorise sterilisation of a child for a non-therapeutic purpose (as opposed to being a by-product of medical treatment for some therapeutic purpose), particularly one who is intellectually disabled, is beyond “the ordinary scope of a parental power to consent to medical treatment. Court authorisation is necessary.” In Re Marion (No. 2) [1992] FamCA 87 Nicholson CJ held that the performance of a hysterectomy was in Marion’s best interests, and he set out several factors which apply in determining the question. On the other hand, Warnick J in L & GM & MM [1993] FamCA 124 refused an application by par- ents for an order for sterilisation of their hospitalised 17 year old, physically and intellectually disabled daughter (which the parents were arguing was necessary for reasons of hygiene, control of epilepsy and prevention of pregnancy), not being satisfied “on the balance of probabilities, to a firm degree on clear and convincing proof, that the proposed procedure was in the child’s best interest”. No special weight was given to the parents’ wishes in that case. The Full Court did allow a hysterectomy (without removal of the ovaries) upon a severely intellectu- ally disabled child to prevent menstruation and the risk of pregnancy, where the parents’ application was supported by the child’s separate representative (now ICL). See also Re Angela [2010] FamCA 98 (hysterectomy for 11 year old girl).

Ultimately, the Full Court was not required to decide (as the surgeons did not pursue their recommendation of the procedure and the parents put in place alternative treatments) and so the case turned solely on the powers of the Victorian Public Advocate. Sex reassignment In Re: Kelvin [2017] FamCAFC 258 the Full Court heard a case stated by Watts J as to the father’s application for the court’s sanction in accordance with Re: Jamie [2013] FamCAFC 110 of the com- mencement of “Stage 2” treatment for Gender Dysphoria (“the distress experienced by a person due to incongruence between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth”: Re: Kelvin at [6]) for his then 16 year old child “Kelvin” who was born female but ([27]) “transitioned socially as a transgender person” from Year 8. The Full Court held in Re: Jamie that the court’s approval under s 67ZC FLA was not required for “Stage 1” treatment (“puberty blocking treatment”) but that Stage 2 treatment (“gender affirming hormone treatment”) involving the use of oestrogen or testosterone with irreversible effects would require the court’s approval. However, a full bench of the Full Court in Re: Kelvin departed from Re: Jamie by hold- ing that the court’s sanction is no longer required for Stage 2 treatment of Gender Dysphoria where the child is capable of giving informed consent and the child’s parents do not object to the treatment; and that where a child is incapable of giving valid consent those with parental responsibility may authorise such treatment without the court’s approval.

Under the Family Law Act, a presumption of par- entage arises from marriage (s 69P), cohabitation (s 69Q), registration of birth (s 69R), a court finding (s 69S), a signed acknowledgment of paternity (s 69T), and artificial conception (s 60H). Rebuttal of presumption The presumption of paternity is rebuttable by proof on the balance of probabilities (s 69U). This section would be relevant where an alleged father refuses to undergo a parentage test (subject to G v H below) and adduces evidence pointing to the improbability of him being the father. Power of court to order parentage testing If the paternity of a child is “in issue”, the court may require a parentage testing procedure to be carried out for the purpose of obtaining information to assist in determining the parentage of the child: s 69W. Mullane J in Diggins [1991] FamCA 100 said: “It is not a proper use of the section to allow a fishing expedition by way of paternity tests… in situations where there is no real evidence to place the paternity of the child in issue.” The court held that an order should not be made so that an alleged father can satisfy his doubts as to a child’s paternity. The court continued: “There must be some real issue as to paternity, some evidence which places the paternity of the child in doubt, before a court can embark upon the process of subjecting the child to the procedures for paternity testing and making an order for that purpose.” (It has been held that the court will make the order if an applicant has an honest, bona fide and reason- able doubt: Butler J in F & R [1992] FamCA",

Section 69W goes on to say that the order can be made on the court’s own initiative, or on the applica- tion of a party or an ICL representing a child’s interests under s 68L; and that an order may be directed to the child, the mother or any other person relevant to the question of determining paternity. For a review of the legislation and case law as to the court’s power to make a parentage testing order see the judgment of Bryant CJ of the Full Court in Brianna [2010] FamCAFC 97 at paras 17-31. Refusal to submit to test A majority of the High Court said in G v H [1994] HCA 48 at [12] of its judgment: “ … in the circumstances … the … inference to be drawn from G’s continuing contravention of the order that he submit to testing was that it was more probable than not that the outcome of the test would be unfavourable to him. And that must lead to the finding that, on the probabilities, he was the father of the child.” Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

The court is reluctant to deny an application for parentage testing. See the Full Court decision in Duroux & Martin [1993] FamCA 125, where the court held that paternity should fundamentally be regarded as a medical rather than a legal issue. Where alleged father is under 18 The testing of minors requires the consent of a parent or responsible person: F & R (above) at p 79,274–5. A child may be forcibly tested if he refuses when a parent or responsible person has consented on his behalf: see s 69Z and 69ZA. The regulations are made under s 69ZB, and test results may be received in evidence under s 69ZC. Testing should be carried out by laboratories accredited by the National Association of Testing Authori- ties, Australia (NATA): Regulation 21N.

Scroll down for the results. Procedure This is set out in Regulations 72 to 73 of the Family Law Regulations. Other necessary orders a court may make are set out in s 69X. Declarations of parentage Under s 69VA, upon determining the issue of parentage of a child, the court may also issue a declaration of parentage that is conclusive evidence of paternity for the purpose of all laws of the Commonwealth, including s 29(2)(c) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 as the basis for a child support assessment against the person found to be the child’s father.",

Reconsideration of a final parenting order is governed by s 65DAAA enacted by the Family Law Amendment Act 2023. “65DAAA Reconsideration of final parenting orders (1) If a final parenting order is in force in relation to a child, a court must not reconsider the final parenting order unless: (a) the court has considered whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made; and (b) the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances (and taking into account whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made), it is in the best interests of the child for the final parenting order to be reconsidered. (2) For the purposes of determining whether the court is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), and without limiting section 60CC, the court may have regard to any matters that the court considers relevant, including the following: (a) the reasons for the final parenting order and the material on which it was based; (b) whether there is any material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order [Rice & Asplund at [7] referred to “some factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material”] (c) the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way); (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to",

It was held that “there is no discernible difference between the first stage test or threshold to be applied under the new statutory regime, and the common law principles espoused by the rule in Rice and Asplund” ([63]). The majority said (at [79]): “… The word ‘consider’ in s 65DAAA should be construed to mean the Court is required to con- template the evidence and to make findings of fact as to what changes in circumstances (if any) there have been since the making of the anterior parenting orders. If there is no positive finding of changed circumstances, that is the end of the matter.

Preliminary matter or part of the final hearing The Full Court in Bennett [1990] FamCA 148 at [63] said that it was discretionary as to whether the rule should be applied as a threshold question, but in that case it preferred the rule to be dealt with as a preliminary matter. In King & Finneran [2001] FamCA 344 it was held that as the previous order had been made so recently (within a year) the rule should be dealt with at a preliminary hearing. The application for a re-hearing failed. In SPS & PLS [2008] FamCAFC 16 Warnick J said at [51] that Evatt CJ “formulated the rule as one to be applied as a preliminary matter” as a means “to discourage ‘endless litigation’” ([56]). The variation was allowed as it accorded with newly expressed wishes of the children and only amounted to a relatively small increase in their time with their father. Examples of facts where variation allowed In Radecki (above from [87]) the Full Court held that the destruction of a formerly cooperative parent- ing arrangement combined with the 6+ years that had passed since orders were made (and the child’s greater maturity) were “a significant change of circumstances”. Variation was allowed in SCVG & KLD [2009] FMCAfam 708 (children wanting more time with F; M blocking him from decision-making) (also Morton & Berry [2014] FamCAFC 208 as to child’s wishes); in Galvez & Rendon [2009] FMCAfam 201 (prior consent order; M repartnered interstate;",

Your client either will or will not know where the respondent has taken the child. If the child’s whereabouts are known apply to the FCFCA for an urgent listing and either a recovery order or the injunction at our precedent “interim parenting orders” under the headings “recovery order” and “injunction – unilateral relocation within Australia” (which requires the respondent to return and, if applicable, to re-enrol the child at school). An order for urgent listing is in our precedent under “recovery order”. You would usually only seek an ex parte order if there were a risk of harm to the children if the order were not made without notice to the respondent. Also see Drew & Jensen [2017] FCCA 656 from [26] and Chapter 8 (“applying for interim or procedural order without notice”). The court’s power to make a recovery order is under s 67U of the Family Law Act. If their whereabouts are not known your client may apply for a location order addressed to Centrelink and (for 4 quarterly address checks) a Commonwealth information order (see “disappearance by other party with child” below and our precedent “interim parenting orders”). An applicant may apply for a recovery order whether a parenting order is in force (see s 67T(a)-(caa)) or not, under s 67T(ca) as a grandparent of the child or s 67T(d) as a person concerned with the care, wel- fare or development of the child.

In Renald (No. 2) [2017] FamCAFC 133 Thackray J (on appeal from a family law magistrate of the FCWA) agreed with M ([18]-[19]) that the delay in listing (“notwithstanding [that] the school year was about to commence” ([2])) was not justified and (in making the recovery order refused by the magistrate) said (at [82]) that “parents should not take matters into their own hands where there is no evidence of risk”.

Attach to your supporting affidavit a copy of any letter from you cautioning the other party against absconding with the child. Disappearance by other party with child As this next procedure can be slow to produce results, make every effort to ascertain the respondent’s whereabouts instead of taking the following action. Most absconding parents do not disappear but go to the home of a relative or friend. So make appropriate inquiries as to their whereabouts so as to avoid having to take the cumbersome steps under this heading. Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

These orders should be sought as interim orders in addition to your interim and final parenting orders (as above). A location order requires a person (e.g. friend or family member) or a Commonwealth department such as Centrelink or the ATO (which may have a record of a child’s address) to inform the court registry of that address: s 67J. The court arranges for that person or department to be served with the order and if you have also applied for leave under s 67P (see our precedent “interim parenting orders”) the registry will notify you. Also seek an adjournment and then arrange personal service of your court papers con- taining the new return date. A Commonwealth information order is the same, but requires the depart- ment’s records to be searched for that address every 3 months for a year. If a child cannot be located through a location or Commonwealth information order, a publication order can be sought (as a further interim order) under s 121. A publication order is one that permits a person to publish in a newspaper or periodical publication or by radio broadcast or television an account of family law proceedings, and a request for assistance from the public to locate the child. A precedent publication order is available at our online “forms and precedents”. The pre-action steps can be waived on the ground of urgency. What to file?

They can be reached by phone on 131 232. A parent or person with parental responsibility for a child is entitled to do this. Such a request warns the passport office that the other party may apply for a child’s passport without consent. It is actioned imme- diately, and a Child Alert will remain in force for 12 months or until the child turns 18, marries or a court order discharges it. Child Alert Request form To request a child alert you must lodge or send a Child Alert Request form (PC9) to DFAT as above. The form is available by phone 131 232 (the Australian Passport Information Service) and at passport offices. Note – Your Request is to be accompanied by either a certified copy of any existing parenting order or (if not stated on the request form itself) a statement confirming that your client is entitled to make the request, being a parent or a person who has parental responsibility under s 61C of the Family Law Act. You should also include a statement to explain why you are requesting a child alert.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 67 Overseas child abduction Australia and most other countries are parties to the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction signed at The Hague on 25 October 1980 (known as the Hague Convention) and have made reciprocal regulations to put the Convention into effect as between convention countries. Our regulations are the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations 1986. The court of a convention country to or in which a child (under 16) has been removed or retained in breach of a person’s rights of custody is required by its regulations, upon a request (in our regulations, above, now called an “application”) being made by that person, to make an order for the return of the child to the child’s home country (Reg 11(1)). Unless specified circumstances apply, the court’s discretion to refuse to order the return of a child is limited: Reg 16(3). Action is to be taken as quickly as a proper consideration of the matter allows: Reg 5(1) and (3). Persons with “rights of custody” – being most parents in Australia, under the definition below – are entitled to make such a request if the child has been removed or retained in breach of those rights: Reg 11(1). Each convention country uses a Central Authority as its enforcement agency, through which requests for the return of a child wrongly removed or retained are made. The Central Authority then refers the application to the Central Authority of the convention country to which the child has been abducted. We have a Central Authority for the Commonwealth and one for each State and Territory (Regs 8 and 9). It is there your request is to be lodged (Reg 11). It is then transmitted to the Commonwealth Central Authority for action (Reg 13). For a list",

Note – It can be easier to recover a child from overseas than from interstate, unless the child is taken to a non-convention country (in which case something more ingenious may be called for) or the case is contested in the foreign court. Also note – If a parenting order is in force, it is a crime to remove a child from Australia without the other parent’s prior written consent or an order authorising such travel (s 65Y of the FLA), punishable by up to three years imprisonment. This could be a trap for any parent who believes that they can take an overseas holiday with their child during their scheduled time without notifying and obtaining the consent of the other parent.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 71 Summary of forms and procedure Child abduction proceedings are brought under the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations 1986. The forms are under Schedule 3. Convention countries have mirror regulations. Upon receiving your Form 1 request for the return of a child – available at our online “forms and precedents” – the Central Authority (CA) will file an application in the foreign court. The CA’s application to the court here or overseas is Form 2. A child removed to or retained in Australia comes under Reg 14(1); a threat of removal from Australia under Reg 14(2); removal from Australia or wrongful retention in a convention country under Reg 14(3). A person served with a Form 2 must file an answer, or an answer and a cross-application in Form 2A. The applicant (CA) may file a reply in accordance with Form 2B. In contested cases the following statutory issues will apply. RELEVANT FACTORS FOR ANY CONTESTED PROCEEDINGS The following is the law applied reciprocally either by a foreign court in a convention country (which may hear an application of yours for the return of a child) or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia where a child has been wrongfully brought here from overseas. At the overseas hearing of your case, the law applied will be confined to the court’s obligation under the regulations to make an order for the return of your client’s child if (which often occurs) their application goes undefended in the foreign court. Should you receive instructions to represent a party where a parent is alleged to have brought a child to Australia wrongfully, you should refer a full statement of the facts to your barrister with a brief to advise, to prepare any necessary court papers and appear at the hearing.",

Foreign court’s obligation to make a return order Regulation 16 of the Regulations sets out the pre-requisites for the return of a child, and will be reciprocal with those of the country to which the child has been taken: see our Reg 1A(2)(c). Under Reg 16(1) the court must make the order if: • An application (by the Central Authority on your client’s behalf) for a return order is made; and • The application is filed within one year after the child’s removal or “retention” (see below); and • The Central Authority satisfies the court that the child’s removal or retention was wrongful. “Wrongful removal or retention” Reg 16(1A) states that a child’s removal or retention is wrongful if ALL of the following apply: (a) The child was under 16; (b) The child “habitually resided” (see below) in a convention country immediately before removal or retention; (c) The applicant had rights of custody in relation to the child in that country; (d) The removal or retention is in breach of those rights of custody; (e) At the time of the removal or retention, the applicant was “actually exercising those rights” (either jointly or alone, or would have done if the child had not been removed or retained) (see below). “Retention” only occurs where a child has been taken to another country by consent – for a holiday, or contact with a parent or for some other reason – when the parent fails to return the child when they are due to do so under the parties’ agreement: House of Lords in Re H (minors) [1991] 2 AC 476;",

It was held in Handbury & State Central Authority and Anor [2020] FamCAFC 5 that M’s repudiation of an agreement for the family’s temporary stay in Australia was a breach of F’s rights of custody in UK. Applications more than one year after removal: when court must order child’s return Reg 16(2). The prerequisites for the court doing so are the same as for applications made within a year, except that instead of proving “wrongfulness”, it is necessary for the court to be satisfied that the person opposing the return has not established that the child has “settled in their new environment”: Reg 16(2) (defined below). Cases where this will apply will be where a child is taken overseas by consent for, say, a year (e.g. for study, or some other reason) but is not returned at the end of that time (the date of “retention” being the date of failure to return on the due (agreed) date, not the date of any threat not to return the child: see cases above as to “retention”). “Settled in his or her new environment” This can occur even though the child is still experiencing problems: Department of Community Services & M & C [1998] FamCA 1518 at [62].

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 77 CONTRAVENTION OF PARENTING ORDERS From 6 May 2024 an Application – Contravention is to be filed where your client alleges a breach of a parenting order: FLR 11.64. The Application – Enforcement is no longer to be used in a parenting case. The form to be filed in WA will be governed by FCR 433. As s 60I extends to contravention applications, an applicant must first make a genuine effort to resolve the matter by means of family dispute resolution (FDR) with the respondent. The usual exceptions and the option of seeking an exemption from attending FDR apply and are explained in the new Application – Contravention (as are what is to be filed with the Application). Applicants will be required to specify the orders being sought. An accompanying notice to the respondent confirms that the court may: • vary or suspend the relevant parenting order • order the respondent to attend a post-separation parenting program • make an order for make-up time • require the respondent to enter into a bond • order that the respondent pay all or some of the applicant’s legal costs • order that the respondent pay compensation for reasonable expenses lost as a result of the contravention (for example, air fares) • order the respondent to pay a fine • order that the respondent be imprisoned Applicants must file an affidavit annexing the relevant order, containing proof that the respondent is aware of the order and evidence in support of each alleged contravention (and of any orders sought). Respondents may file an affidavit but are not required to (FLR 11.67; FCR 437) (and, we suggest, an Application in a Proceeding with affidavit in support should be filed if they are seeking an order too).

What constitute a “child-related order” are set out in s 70NBA(2). The principal objects of Division 13A Section 70NAB – They are to meet the best interests of children … by: (a) supporting compliance with child-related orders; (b) resolving difficulties associated with [such] orders … which have contributed to non-compliance … (including by varying or making further orders); (c) deterring non-compliance … ; (d) … enforcing compliance … [if] necessary and appropriate; and (e) … sanctions for a person who contravenes … without reasonable excuse. Meaning of contravene a child-related order Section 70NAC(1)(a) provides that a person contravenes a child-related order only if he or she intention- ally fails to comply with it or makes no reasonable attempt to comply with it. Meaning of reasonable excuse for contravening a child-related order (s 70NAD) Where person did not understand obligations (1) A person has a reasonable excuse for contravening a child-related order if: (a) the person contravened the order because at the time of the contravention the person did not understand the obligations imposed by the order; and (b) the court considers that the person ought to be excused in respect of the contravention. (2) If the court decides that a person has a reasonable excuse under subsection (1) for contravening a child-related order, the court must explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person: (a) the obligations imposed on the person by the order; and (b) the consequences that may follow if the person",

Their primary function is to provide reports to the court under s 62G (and, at divorce hearings where necessary, under s 55A). See ss 11A to 11G. The court may require parties and children to see a family consultant (s 11F). Although one of their roles is to help parties resolve disputes, there is no confidentiality. Your clients should be advised that anything said to a family consultant may be reported. They will prepare reports (for interim and final hearings); and for final hearings be required for cross-examination. Family consultants may also be called on to supervise or assist compliance with parenting orders (s 65L) or to recommend that the parties attend a post-separation parenting program (s 65LA). Family reports Terms of reference for these reports should be the relevant considerations under s 60CC: Hardwick [2013] FCWA 57 at [36]-[38]. A family consultant may be directed under s 62G(2) to give the court a report on matters relevant to a child’s best interests. The section goes on to cover adjournments until the report is given and the requirement that the views of the child be ascertained (unless inappropriate). A child’s views may also be placed before the court through the child’s ICL (see “ICL” below). The report may be received in evidence under s 62G(8). For the procedure see FLR 8.11 (in WA, FCR 235).

A court is not bound to accept it; (b) Reports are meant to be and usually are valuable material to assist the court in forming ultimate conclusions; (c) A counsellor does not usually have the same opportunity as the court to weigh the evidence, observe the demeanour of witnesses and make findings of fact; (d) A counsellor’s assessment of parties may be based on facts which turn out to be wrong or may be different from the court’s assessment after testing of the credit of the parties; (e) A report may be neutral, by concluding that a child’s best interests will be equally well (or ill) served by either party. Hall was applied in Summerby & Cadogen [2011] FamCAFC 205 at [118]-[119]. Note – A family consultant may be discharged if not seen to have been objective and independent: Gaines [2013] FMCAfam 108 at [13]-[23]. What to file?

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 84 INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER Court order for independent representation of child’s interests Section 68L applies to a case where a child’s best interests are, or a child’s welfare is, the paramount, or a relevant, consideration. This includes proceedings under regulations made for the purposes of s 111B (about the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction): s 68L(1). An independent children’s lawyer (“ICL”) is a court-appointed legally aided lawyer independently repre- senting a child’s interests in proceedings: s 68L(2). The child, an organisation concerned with the welfare of children or any other person may apply for such an order: s 68L(4). The court may (subject to subsection (6) as to the child’s age, maturity or some other special circumstance) make an order allowing the ICL to find out what the child’s views are: s 68L(5) (although a child may not be required to express a view: s 60CE). The Full Court in Re K [1994] FamCA 21 held that the criteria for such an appointment include the following: • Alleged child abuse • Neither party legally represented • Unsuitability of either parent • A parent’s sexual preferences • Intractable parental conflict • Special medical procedure for child • Proposal to remove child far away • Anti-social conduct of a parent • Alienation from a parent • Strong wish of mature child for change • Proposal to separate siblings • Medical or other disorder of parent • Cultural/religious differences Role of an independent children’s lawyer • Forms an independent view of what is in the child’s best interests, on the available evidence: s 68LA(2)(a) • Acts in what the ICL believes to the child’s best interests: s 68LA(2)(b) • Makes submissions for the court to act in a particular way in the best interests of",

Note: A person cannot require a child to express the child’s views in relation to any matter (see section 60CE). (5AA) The independent children’s lawyer has discretion in relation to the following matters (subject to any order or direction of the court with respect to the matter, for example under paragraph 68L(2)(b) or paragraph (5D)(b) of this section): (a) when, how often and how meetings with the child take place; (b) when, how often and how the child is provided with an opportunity to express views.

(5C) Without limiting paragraph (5B)(c), exceptional circumstances for the purposes of that paragraph include that performing the duty, would: (a) expose the child to a risk of physical or psychological harm that cannot be safely managed; or (b) have a significant adverse effect on the wellbeing of the child.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR 4 – 86 Disclosure of information An ICL may disclose to the court any information a child communicates to the ICL if the ICL considers the disclosure to be in the best interests of the child: s 68LA(7) (even if the disclosure is made against the wishes of the child: s 68LA(8)). Order that child be made available for examination The court may, on application by the ICL, order a parent or other person who has parental responsibility to make a child available for an examination for the purpose of preparing a report about the child for use by the ICL: s 68M. Removal of an independent children’s lawyer Kemp FM in Somers & Chubb (above) at [13]-[17] reviewed case law as to whether and in what circum- stances an ICL should be removed. In Baker & Borthwick and Ors [2010] FamCA 1018 Ryan J criticised the ICL for “aggressively pursuing” a particular finding (unacceptable risk of sexual abuse of child) “without considering [other key evi- dence]”, ultimately finding that some of the material relied on by the ICL “had little or no forensic value”. In Kingley & Arndale (No. 2) [2010] FamCA 968 where bias was alleged against an ICL, O’Reilly J discussed the role of an ICL and dismissed the allegation, saying at [31]: “It is fundamental … that even in cases of alleged apprehended bias, some actual conduct of the person sought to be impugned be identified, and that there be a finding that such conduct, in the view of the objective bystander, realistically could give rise to the opinion that the person is not impartial.” In Fisher [2021] FamCA 236 it was held that an ICL’s failure to properly respond to reasonable enquiries made by a self-represented litigant does not warrant the ICL’s removal.",

Urgent listing For urgent cases, seek an interim order “that the application be heard on an urgent basis and that all times for service be abridged”, explaining the urgency in your covering letter to the registry. In Myers [2011] FMCAfam 1104 at [87] Halligan FM held that a case should be listed urgently if the Registrar is satisfied as to a reasonably arguable case; prejudice beyond the norm in the absence of an urgent listing; no unreasonable or unexplained delay; and a judicial officer being available to hear the application. It was held in Ghorbani & Saeed [2013] FamCAFC 167 at [16]-[25] that a recovery application must be heard immediately or listed urgently. Review of registrar’s order A registrar’s powers are set out in FLR 14.04 and Schedule 4 FLR (in WA, FCR 321). For an appli- cation for review of a registrar’s order e.g. refusal to list urgently, see Hathaway [2012] FMCAfam 1447. File an Application for Review (no affidavit). It will be listed as a hearing de novo. Duty of disclosure Parties must disclose relevant documents, e.g. criminal records, filed AVO documents, medical reports, school reports (FLR 6.05; in WA, FCR 197) and an expert’s report (FLR 7.14). Expert witnesses Family reports under s 62G FLA are governed by FLR 8.11 (in WA, FCR 235). For expert evidence as to a significant issue in dispute, see Chapter 7 FLR (in WA, Div 5 of Part 15 FCR).

The Court will consider any need for urgent or interim orders and case management directions, e.g. for a family report or Case Assessment Conference. In the FCFCA, see Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management (“CPD”). The timeframe is within 1-2 months for directions by a Judicial Registrar. Before that event, each lawyer must provide to the court and each party notice that their client has made a genuine attempt to resolve issues in dispute; of the costs paid and anticipated; likely duration of final hearing and costs thereto; of whether a party is legally aided; and of whether the parties have agreed to privately fund the cost of any expert report and dispute resolution. The Court will make any orders by consent; list any interim hearing; direct any parties who have not complied with the pre-action procedures to do so; identify the issues in dispute and the steps required to resolve them; consider whether the case is suitable for court-based dispute resolution, having regard to the means and resources of the parties, or whether it is suitable for referral to ex- ternal dispute resolution (or, with the consent of the parties, arbitration); consider whether the case Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

The following are the forms of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Applicants • Initiating Application (Family Law) Insert the interim and final orders from “interim orders sought” and “final orders sought” in “prec- edents” below. An interim order not sought in an Initiating Application may be sought by filing an Application in a Proceeding (below) and an affidavit explaining why the interim order is sought. A birth certificate is no longer required to be filed with an Initiating Application. • Notice of child abuse, family violence or risk This form must be filed with an Initiating Application or Response seeking parenting orders whether risk is alleged or not (and if risk is alleged your affidavit should include the facts relied on). The form is here at our eBook and at our online “forms and precedents”. The FCWA has its own Form 4 as per “FCWA forms” above, to be filed if such an allegation is made. In both courts any relevant family violence order is to be filed too. • Affidavit An affidavit should not be filed until you are directed to do so except in support of an interim ap- plication. See “precedents” below for sample affidavit of applicant both for interim and for final hearings. If seeking final orders only, use the precedent below for an “affidavit for final order”. If seeking interim and final orders use the affidavit for the interim orders (filing an affidavit for final orders later). • Certificate of Dispute Resolution This is obtained from the parties’ FDR provider.

Mutual undertakings, such as to keep the peace towards each other, may also be appropriate. Under- takings are usually drawn up informally at court. Sample text is at our online “forms & precedents”. Consent orders The terms of any settlement may be documented as a consent order, signed by the parties and filed in the court. For these terms, see “interim orders sought” and “final orders sought” below. For precedent cover sheets, see “consent orders” in the chapter “other routine procedures”. Later interim applications Interim orders (if not sought in the Initiating Application) “(IA)” may be sought after an IA has been filed, by filing an Application in a Proceeding and an affidavit in support. Respondents must file a Response to an Application in a Proceeding and an affidavit replying to each paragraph of the applicant’s affidavit. Amended applications Any new orders may be sought after an IA as “Amended Initiating Application” showing the new orders sought underlined in red, and “amended” appearing wherever “initiating application” is mentioned). No filing fee is payable. An affidavit setting out the facts relied on for the new orders sought can be contained in an affidavit filed before the final hearing, unless your new orders sought are interim in which case you would have to file another affidavit prior to the interim hearing.

At this stage, we have recommended to our client that [you both/the parties] discuss arrangements for the [child/children] with the assistance of a Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) practitioner. We find that better progress is usually made at the early stage of a separation by not involving lawyers until after the parties have discussed child issues informally with an FDR person. We have given our client the name of an experienced FDR provider who would be available, namely [insert FDR provider’s name, address and telephone number/s]. Any agreement reached during FDR can be documented and filed in the court as a joint application for binding consent orders. Although FDR is compulsory, would you please confirm that you agree to attending, and let us know of any preferred times. An appointment would then be made for FDR to occur at a convenient time. We suggest the FDR provider’s fee be shared equally, unless for some reason it is not reasonable for the fee to be shared. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

      "text": "CHILDREN 4 – 117 A NOTE ABOUT INTERIM AFFIDAVITS This note applies to the following sample affidavits for interim hearings. An affidavit may be relied on at an interim hearing if it does not exceed 25 pages and contain more than 10 annexures unless leave is granted by the court: FLR 5.08 (cf. FCR 84 in WA). If leave is sought, apply for an order “that leave be granted to [etc] to rely upon the affidavit of [name of deponent] notwithstanding its non-compliance with Rule 5.08 of the [FLR]” and each affidavit should contain facts relevant to why leave should be granted for further material e.g. multiple issues needing to be addressed at the interim hearing (parenting, spousal maintenance, interim injunctions about property); complexity; significant welfare risks to a child that could not otherwise be addressed via subpoena). For general provisions about interlocutory applications, see FLR 5.01 to 5.10 and Central Practice Directions 5.15 to 5.25. A respondent may file a longer affidavit if they are responding to both interim and final issues: Genesalio [2020] FamCAFC 113 at [131]-[134]. SAMPLE AFFIDAVITS FOR INTERIM HEARINGS • It is advisable for you to give your client an outline of the law set out above in this Chapter; and • for your client to make the most of the non-threatening environment of counselling and FDR to negotiate as much of the desired child-sharing arrangement as possible before applying to the court for interim orders. • If the other party has stopped short of agreeing to a reasonable arrangement, file your application, but make your client’s affidavit work for you – keep it simple and in their (not your) language, and keep to the points you need to get across.

So deal with those factors in order of relevance. • The Court said ([72]) that in U v U [2002] HCA 36 the High Court held that “the proper approach … in a relocation case is a weighing of competing proposals, having regard to relevant … [s 60CC] factors, and … other relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the [applicant] … [U]ltimately the decision must be … in the best interests of the child”. • The Full Court added ([84]) that Hayne J in U v U also said that a judge may look beyond the (“selfish”) proposals of the parties (F in U v U had not considered the prospect of his relocating too). • “The proper focus is which is better for the child – to be in the custody of the [respondent] father (in Perth) or to be in the custody of the [applicant] mother (in Darwin). That … requires attention to what benefits will the child have, and what detriments will the child suffer, from being in the moth- er’s custody in Darwin.” per Hayne J in AMS v AIF [1999] HCA 26 at [218]. • Also see our archived children’s case notes under “relocation” for the type of evidence considered in cases similar to yours.] Introduction 1.

So deal with those factors in order of relevance. • The Court said ([72]) that in U v U [2002] HCA 36 the High Court held that “the proper approach … in a relocation case is a weighing of competing proposals, having regard to relevant … [s 60CC] factors, and … other relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the [applicant] … [U]ltimately the decision must be … in the best interests of the child”. • The Full Court added ([84]) that Hayne J in U v U also said that a judge may look beyond the (“selfish”) proposals of the parties (F in U v U had not considered the prospect of his relocating too). • “The proper focus is which is better for the child – to be in the custody of the [respondent] father (in Perth) or to be in the custody of the [applicant] mother (in Darwin). That … requires attention to what benefits will the child have, and what detriments will the child suffer, from being in the moth- er’s custody in Darwin.” per Hayne J in AMS v AIF [1999] HCA 26 at [218]. • Also see our archived children’s case notes under “relocation” for the type of evidence considered in cases similar to yours.] Introduction 1.

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 3 INTRODUCTION Child support is assessed by the Child Support Registrar c/- the Australian Government Department of Human Services (DHS). This is done by applying a formula under Part 5 of the Child Support (Assess- ment) Act 1989 (the “Assessment Act” or the “CSAA”). In the words of the Full Court, in the renowned case of Gyselman [1991] FamCA 93: “The Assessment Act, combined with the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 enables, and in some cases obliges, the assessed liability to be collected through and enforced by the Child Support [Registrar].” Editor’s connection with Gyselman The editor [RGW] was solicitor and counsel for the husband in Gyselman before Frederico J in Hobart, bringing what was to be the last court application for departure from a child support assessment before the introduction of administrative review. The wife’s appeal to the Full Court in Melbourne against the departure order led to the decision cited above. The development of a system of administrative review of assessments has both reduced the lawyer’s role and opened up new avenues for lawyers to act in child support matters. Before examining the work that has been left to lawyers, here is a summary of the new child support scheme introduced to the Assessment Act on 1 July 2008 and of how the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act (CSR&CA), since its own amendments on 1 January 2007, has been used to add further administrative layers to the review of assessed child support. These Acts extend to the maintenance of ex-nuptial children except in WA (s 13 CSAA; s 5 CSR&CA) The website of the Australian Department of Human Services is not that easy to navigate and is ever- changing but it does contain the following: • The Child Support",

An application may be made by phone to the Child Support Registrar (131 272); online at https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-apply-for-child-support-assessment or in writing by com- pleting an “Application for Child Support Assessment”. The completed form may be lodged at a DHS office. Once an application is accepted, the Child Support Registrar will send the parties a notice of child sup- port assessment showing the amount assessed and how it was calculated. The Child Support Registrar is entitled to accept an applicant’s claim that the respondent is a parent if satisfied that the child was born during the parties’ marriage; or the respondent’s name is on the birth certificate; or there has been a court finding of paternity. Eligible children also include an adopted child; a child of a separated married couple born within 44 weeks after resumption of cohabitation; and a child born to an unmarried couple who cohabited between 44 and 20 weeks before the birth (s 29). Child support is assessed at an annual rate, payable monthly, and ends when the child turns 18 or becomes “a member of a couple” (s 24) or on other terminating events such as adoption (s 12). A child who turns 18 in their last year of school may have their child support extended to the end of that school year if the carer entitled to child support applies before",

This material is copyright of the Commonwealth of Australia, and is reproduced under permission of the Com- monwealth: “Every family is unique, and the child support formula is flexible and takes into account many different family circumstances. It ensures a balanced and flexible way of working out child support payments. The key components of the formula are: • the costs of raising children, based on independent research, are the basis of the formula • both parents’ incomes are taken into account and considered equally • the same self-support amount is deducted from each parent’s income before child support is worked out • the level of care each parent provides is taken into account • children from first and subsequent families are treated in a similar way We follow eight steps to calculate child support: 1. Work out your child support income (If you have dependent children or more than two child support assessments, this will be taken into account at this step). 2. Work out the combined child support income 3. Work out your income percentage 4. Work out your care percentage 5. Work out your cost percentage 6. Work out your child support percentage 7. Work out the cost of your child (You will get either a positive or negative child support percentage. If the percentage is positive, you need to pay child support.) 8. Work out the child support amount (This is the) basic formula (which) applies to parents with one child support assessment and no other dependent children. This is the formula we use for",

      "text": "CHAPTER FIVE 5 – 6 The eight steps to calculate child support 1 Work out each parent’s child support income This is each parent’s taxable income (plus any net rental loss and fringe benefits) less the “parenting self support amount” which is $18,252 as at 2008 (indexed annually). If a person has other dependent children or more than two child support assessments, a deduction is made at this step. 2 Work out the combined child support income The combined child support income is the child support income of the parents added together. 3 Work out your income percentage By combining the child support income at step 2, each parent’s child support income can be viewed as a percentage. Example: If Jane’s child support income amount is $20,000 and John’s is $60,000 at step 1, then: • the combined child support income is $80,000 (step 2); • Jane’s income percentage is 25%; and • John’s income percentage is 75%. 4 Work out your care percentage A parent’s care percentage is based on the number of nights in a 365 night calendar year the child lives with each parent. Example: If the above couple had one child who lived with Jane for 292 nights a year, and John 73 nights a year: • Jane’s care percentage is 80%; • John’s care percentage is 20%. 5 Work out your cost percentage Each party’s cost percentage is calculated from their percentage of care (step 4), using this table in s 55C (CSAA): Care percentage Cost percentage Nil to less than 14% Nil 14% to less than 35% 24% 35% to less than 48% 25% + 2% for every % > 35% 48% to 52% 50% More than 52% to 65% 51% + 2% for every % > 53% Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

John’s care percentage was 20%, so his cost percentage is 24%. 6 Work out your child support percentage Each parent’s income percentage (step 3) minus their cost percentage (step 5) represents their child support percentage. Example: • Jane: 25% – 76% = – 51% child support % • John: 75% – 24% = 51% child support % If the child support percentage is positive, you need to pay child support – the liable parent. If the child support percentage is negative, you are entitled to receive child support – the parent entitled to child support. 7 Work out the cost of your child This is calculated by the table in Schedule 1 (CSAA) that is updated annually and can be found on the DHS website here at our eBook. Example: The combined child support income of John and Jane (step 2) was $80,000. Under the table, if their child is under 12, the cost of the child is $8,761 plus $0.12 for every dollar over $54,756. So the cost of their child would be $8,761 + ($25,244 x 0.12) = $11,790.28. 8 Work out the child support amount Finally, multiply the liable parent’s child support percentage (step 6) by the cost of the child (step 7). Example: John, being the liable parent, would be assessed to pay 51% of $11,790.28 = $6,013.04 per annum, or $501.08 per month. Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 9 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW There are no fewer than six opportunities for administrative (in-house) review available to parties, with some intermediate avenues enabling them to go directly to court. These opportunities are by means of informing the Child Support Registrar (“Registrar”) of any change to a formula element; a change of assessment initiated by the Registrar; applying for an administrative change of assessment (administrative departure from the assessment); lodging an objection requiring the Registrar to reconsider a decision; review of the reconsidered decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT); and an appeal to a court from the AAT on a question of law. For more information see The Child Support Guide. 1. Notification by a parent of change to a formula element The easiest way that a parent can ensure the correctness of their assessment is by keeping the Registrar (via their child support officer) informed of: • any new care arrangement for the children (ss 52 or 74A) • any change in the number of dependent children (s 73A) • any change of income (ss 34A, 58A and 63A) • any terminating event (ss 74 and 12) ensuring that they inform the Registrar of any such change within 14 days (s 160). If a liable parent’s income decreases by more than 15%, they can lodge with the Registrar an “Estimate of income for use in a child support assessment” under s 60 of the CSAA (for the form, see under “administrative forms” below). An estimate of income, if accepted by the Registrar, becomes that parent’s adjusted taxable income amount for the purpose of the administrative formula. Once lodged, the Registrar will review the estimate and either accept or reject it. Note – If you help a client lodge such an estimate, you should advise",

Change of assessment initiated by Child Support Registrar The Registrar can initiate a change of assessment without an application from the payer or payee if it is satisfied that the assessment is “unfair” (the wording used in the DHS website) because of a parent’s income, earning capacity, property or financial resources, and that it is just and equitable and otherwise proper to change the assessment (ss 98K and 98L CSAA). The Registrar may also make a discretionary amendment of an assessment in certain circumstances as set out in s 75. 3. Administrative change of assessment in special circumstances Part 6A of the CSAA (s 98B) empowers the Child Support Registrar, upon the application of a liable parent or carer entitled to child support, to depart from a child support assessment upon any of the several grounds for departure contained in s 117(2) that a court once could use to review an administra- tive assessment (Gyselman, above), and still can in the circumstances set out below (see “application to court for a departure order”). Note – Although the departure grounds are meant to be the same, the form of application to the Registrar (see below) uses a simplified (and somewhat different) version of those grounds which are called “The 10 reasons for making an application” and comes with examples of the financial circumstances giving rise to each of those administrative grounds. A Senior Case Officer hears the parties either in conference together or separately (even by phone); examines the application, response (see below for these forms) and any documents produced by either party in support of their case; and then, if the parties cannot agree on the amount of child support to be paid, gives the decision and its reasons to each party.

Objection requiring Child Support Registrar to reconsider Part VII of the CSR&CA was introduced on 1 January 2007 to provide for internal reconsideration of decisions of the Registrar under the CSAA and CSR&CA before they may be reviewed by the AAT (Step 5). Part VII is invoked when a person lodges an objection in writing to a Registrar’s decision. For the type of decision and who may object, see s 80 of the CSR&CA. An objection to a decision to accept an application for administrative assessment may not be lodged on the ground that the person is not a parent of the child: s 80(4) An objection, fully stating its grounds, is to be lodged in writing within 28 days (ss 81 and 84) and a copy served by the Registrar on the other party (s 85); may be lodged out of time (s 82); may be opposed (s 86); and must be considered within 60 days (s 83).

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 17 PATERNITY DISPUTES For presumptions of paternity and the court’s power to order parentage testing, see “paternity” in Chapter 4. Application to court for a declaration as to paternity There are two types of declaration: 1. If the Registrar refuses to accept an application for child support, one of the reasons for which is the Registrar not being satisfied that the other party is a parent, an application may be made to a court for a declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child: s 106A of the CSAA. 2. If the Registrar accepts an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child, an application may be made to a court for a declaration that a party should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the party is not a parent of the child: s 107 of the CSAA. The court will usually order that a parentage testing procedure be carried out for the purpose of obtain- ing information to assist in determining the parentage of the child: s 69W of the FLA. Under s 69W the order can be made on the court’s own initiative or on the application of a party; and may be directed to the child, the mother or any other person relevant to the question of determining paternity. Time limits The application must be filed within 56 days of receiving notice of the Registrar’s refusal to assess (s 106A CSAA) or its acceptance of an application for child support (s 107 CSAA): FLR 1.13(3) (in WA, FCR 69). The court may extend that time limit under FLR 15.06 (in WA, FCR 15). As to the relevant",

Refusal to submit to test A majority of the High Court said in G v H [1994] HCA 48 at [12] of its judgment: “ … in the circumstances … the … inference to be drawn from G’s continuing contravention of the order that he submit to testing was that it was more probable than not that the outcome of the test would be unfavourable to him. And that must lead to the finding that, on the probabilities, he was the father of the child.” A religious or cultural objection to the taking of blood (F & R [1992] FamCA 86) is no longer tenable as DNA testing is now by means of a mouth swab. The court is reluctant to deny an application for parent- age testing. See Duroux & Martin [1993] FamCA 125 where the Full Court held that paternity should fundamentally be regarded as a medical rather than a legal issue. Where alleged father is under 18 The testing of minors requires the consent of a parent or responsible person: F and R (above) at p 79,274–5. A child may be forcibly tested if he refuses when a parent or responsible person has consented on his behalf: see s 69Z and 69ZA.

Suspension of payments A declaration under s 107 that a party should not be assessed because the party is not a parent does not operate as a stay of the assessment (s 109A). But an Applicant can notify Child Support of their application whereupon payments to the payee are suspended: s 79A of the CSR&CA. The liable parent must continue to pay the assessment, but the Child Support Registrar will retain amounts paid pending the Court’s decision. Under s 107(5), a successful s 107 application negates the assessment, and the court must as soon as practicable consider making an order under s 143 that any child support paid by such an applicant be recovered from the payee (see next paragraph). Recovery of child support from payee Overpaid amounts are recoverable from the payee, not the Registrar: Child Support Registrar & Z & T [2002] FamCA 182. While an application for recovery must be served on the Child Support Registrar, the liable parent and payee should be the only parties to the proceedings.

The ensuing paternity test confirmed “daddy” not to be the father of the eldest two of his three children, for whom he had been paying child support during an on/off kind of relationship over a period of some years.

I do not accept that to be the case. This is not a case where the doubts about the children’s paternity were kept from (him). I am satisfied that (he) was aware that there were doubts about L’s paternity and about R, although I find that the mother did lead the father to believe in relation to R that it was highly likely that he was his child. Nevertheless, deceit as to paternity was not an issue. Unquestionably the husband hoped that both children were his but he was not deceived as to the possibility, however remote, that they might not be. That is important in my view because the husband thereafter made decisions about the support of the children and about the way in which the parties would conduct themselves as a family in this knowledge. The husband could at any time after the child support assessment was initially made in 1999 have requested paternity testing to satisfy himself that he had an obligation to support the children. He is not to be criticised for this because the actions he took were clearly done on the basis that both he and the wife accepted that they had a family unit and the issue simply did not arise. Their relationship was one which was described as ‘on/off’ for a number of years and did not finally break down until mid-2001.

This reflects the reality of the ongoing personal relationship between the husband and the children. It is a relationship based upon the fact that he has been a father to all three of them and they have regarded him as such. It is in that context that the payments made by him occurred. Insofar as the wife is concerned she conducted herself on a similar basis to the husband, namely that despite their interpersonal difficulties, they had a family unit comprising the husband, wife and three children. There were periods of time up until their final separation when both of them were genuinely trying to reconcile despite their personal difficulties and the other relationships which each of them had at times. The wife has not in the past pursued the biological father of the children for child support, which is again commensurate with the way in which these parties conducted their lives together, as a family. I take all of (these) matters…into account and note that since August 2001 the husband has paid considerably less child support for A than was otherwise due.

In that case: • The parties agreed that the liable parent was not the biological father of the child. • While the father had paid over $20,000 to the mother in child support, he only sought recovery of $5,000 as he considered that reasonable. • It was held at [65]: “There is clearly a prima facie entitlement on the part of the applicant to a refund of the child support paid as provided for in section 143(1). This is subject to orders that the court may make adjusting the rights of the parties and the child under section 143(3) and the court’s power to make such orders as are ‘just and equitable’ to give effect to the rights of the parties and child.” • It was found at [68] that the mother’s conduct was “unfortunate” in that “she must have been aware throughout that there was the possibility that the applicant was not the father. Her failure to disclose this information, at least at the time she sought child support, has led to the circumstances with which the Court is now confronted”. • The parties earned similar incomes at the date of trial, and the mother had received a greater share of the parties’ property settlement. • The mother was ordered to re-pay the Applicant $5,000. Another partial repayment In Forsythe & Latimer & Anor [2010] FMCAfam 478, after $39,000 had been paid, $9,743 was or- dered to be repaid by the mother, being the amount paid to her after the DNA test result had become known.

It is also a case of going back to the Assessment Act (CSAA) for this. Departure applications may be made to a court under Division 4 of Part 7 of the CSAA. Section 116(1) enables a liable parent or carer entitled to child support to apply to a court for an order departing from an administrative assessment in the special circumstances of the case if: (a) the Registrar has refused to make a determination under Part 6A and an objection to that refusal has been disallowed; (aa) after an objection to a decision about an assessment the Registrar has refused to make a Part 6A determination; (ab) the AAT has refused to make a Part 6A determination; (b) either is a party to an application pending before the court, and the court is satisfied that it would be in their interest for the court to consider making such an order; or (c) a liable parent has been assessed for the minimum annual rate of child support. Pending court proceedings? Paragraph (b) – the existence of pending proceedings in court (which can be in relation to any kind of matter) offers lawyers the readiest avenue to the court for a departure application, even if a Part 6A administrative review (Step 2 above) has not been conducted.

The grounds for departure under s 117(2) are: (a) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of: (i) the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person (ii) special needs of any other child or person the parent has a duty to maintain Note – “This would include such things as unusual medical expenditure, facilities for a [disabled] child, etc. If necessary it could include ‘special needs’ in education”: Lightfoot & Hampson [1996] FamCA 8, or the needs of a gifted child: Kay J in Blamey [1994] FamCA 161.

(In) determining the financial capacity of the respondent to meet the claim for child maintenance, there is to be deducted from his income unavoidable or compulsory expenses together with necessary living expenses.’’ The writer [RGW] had argued before the trial judge for the deduction of the husband’s expenses and repayment of debt. The Full Court (at [103]) said: “Whether a particular obligation to pay off a debt should or should not be included within paragraph (a)(iii) depends upon the circumstances of the individual case… Pre-separation debts are not a separate category in their own right but they do arise from joint liabilities of the parties entered into prior to the separation and which one party may be left to meet. Debts incurred by the absent parent necessary to meet his changed circumstances, including furniture and accommodation, may fall within that provision. Many debts would not be included either because they are not sufficiently connected with the paragraph or because they are not reasonable in amount or could by rearrangement of that person’s finances or circumstances have been avoided.” The Court (at [114]) found that the husband’s credit card liability “was part of the property settlement adjustment and should…be disregarded”. The Court (at [70] and [114]) said that a post-separation car loan may not be allowable without some evidence of the necessity to buy the car beyond its being needed during time with the children; and as to furniture said (at [115]-[116]): “The husband borrowed about $2,500 to purchase furniture which he is repaying at $100 per fortnight.

It is to treat the husband in a like manner to somebody in a similar circum- stance by notionally reducing his child support income by the sum equivalent to the amount he would have to earn to have $2811 in his pocket…the cost of the two air fares…Taking into account his marginal tax rate of 30% the amount he would have to earn to provide him with $2811 after tax is $4015. If this amount is deducted from his child support income amount annual payment of $4326 or $83 per week is produced. In the circumstances I am satisfied that this process is a just and equitable result and also preserves the integrity of the child support assessment scheme as Kay J wished to do in Houlihan.” Examples • Airfares, bus, train, car costs for you to spend time with your child • Transport costs and overnight accommodation if you visit your child Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

Kay J held in Mansfield [1991] FamCA 96 that an application under s 117(2)(c) based on a reduction of income could fail where the lodgment of an estimate of income would remedy the issue, as it could not be said that the administrative machinery in the Act produced an unjust or inequitable level of support. • One parent’s business structure means their earning capacity is not accurately reflected in their adjusted taxable income.

For the type of orders the court may make, see s 118. These include an order varying the annual rate of child support payable, or an order varying the various aspects of the assessment calculation such as a person’s cost percentage for a child, child support income, child support percentage, dependent child amount, self-support amount, and varying the costs of the children.

W applied to Registrar for change of assessment under Part 6A due to school fees costing $500 per month. Application refused. 3. W re-applied to Registrar for a change of assessment on the same grounds. Application refused as that ground had already been argued and dismissed. 4. W applied to the court for non-periodic support of $20,000 for school fees. Case was dismissed due to want of jurisdiction (W having applied under FLA not the CSAA).

Was awarded the $20,000 sought for school fees, and an order under s 125 that the amount not be credited against H’s liability under the assessment. The court amended W’s application so as to be under s 123 (not s 124) and also noted that W could have applied to the court for a departure order at Stage 3. 6. H appealed to the Full Court. The Full Court’s reason for its decision was summarised at [82]-[94] as follows: “The wife here seeks payment of school fees as the alteration to the child support assessment. (…) We agree with the dictum of Fogarty J [in Lightfoot & Hampson [1996] FamCA 8] that s 125 was inserted in the legislation ‘because it was apprehended that there might be unusual circumstances where there should not be a credit (against an existing assessment)’... We must therefore consider whether the facts of the present case come within the ambit of this description. In our opinion, the dominant purpose of the (CSAA) is to ensure, as far as possible, that children receive proper and adequate support. We think that in order to apply the test, it is necessary to look at the cumulative effect of the particular circumstances of the case, for although an examination of each individual factor may not produce such a result, a combination of all factors may well do so. In our opinion, the relevant factors in this case which lead us to the conclusion that this case does fall within s 125 are as follows. First, His Honour (the trial judge, Warnick J) found that prior to separation, it was the intention of both parties that the children should have a private school education. Secondly, His",

First, His Honour (the trial judge, Warnick J) found that prior to separation, it was the intention of both parties that the children should have a private school education. Secondly, His Honour found that on the probabilities, the husband could have earned enough to have paid a proper level of child support and to have paid those fees had he wished to do so. Thirdly, as a consequence of the husband’s conduct, the wife has incurred a financial detriment by having had no contribution by the husband towards school fees. Fourthly, His Honour found that the husband was strongly motivated not to pay for private school education for the children and suggested that such lack of motivation extended to the payment of maintenance generally. He further found that he had deliberately reduced his income with a view to evading his child support obligations. Fifthly, His Honour found that he had deliberately concealed past income and was likely to continue to do so in the future. While all of the above factors are relevant, we think that the last two factors are particularly important, since the effect of the husband’s conduct as found by His Honour, was to heavily reduce the quantum of periodical payments for which the husband was liable and render the payments liable to further reduction if the payment of private school fees was to be credited against them. (…) There are some additional factors which support such a conclusion, while not being critical to it, these being the husband’s poor record of payment of periodical payments, the fact that he has assets sufficient to meet the additional obligation that His Honour’s order imposed and the fact that he",

In such circumstances, you should apply instead for a departure order in the form of a lump sum under s 116 of the CSAA. Examples of non-periodic orders • Private school fees, as above in Ivanovic. The order made by Warnick J (left undisturbed by the Full Court) was that to satisfy his judgment that H pay $20,000 for school fees, an order was made for the sale of a parcel of land (owned by H) by W who was appointed the trustee for sale (the proceeds of which to be applied to W as to the $20,000 and H as to the balance of proceeds) • “Capitalisation orders may well be appropriate where there are difficulties in enforcement or where it is proper to sever the financial link between the parties”: Prpic [1994] FamCA 155 at [53] • Where there are assets but, especially as to income, “the father will do everything he can to avoid paying proper child support”: Lindenmayer J in Dwyer & Mcguire [1993] FamCA 82 at [101].

Grounds for such an order The court must not make an order modifying an order under s 123A or 124 unless it is satisfied, having regard to any matter specified in s 123A or statement made under s 125, that it would be: • just and equitable for the child and the parties, and • otherwise proper to make the order: s 129(2) Grounds for varying an order under s 124 The court must vary such an order unless, under s 129(3), it is also satisfied: • that the variation is justified because of a change in the circumstances of the child, the carer entitled to child support or the liable parent since the order was made • that the variation is justified because of a change in the cost of living since the order was made • in a case of an order made by consent – that the order is not proper or adequate, or • that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order, or material evidence previously given before such court was false. “Just and equitable” In considering this the court must have regard to the matters set out in s 117(4)–(8).

What is the demand for child support agreements? Most parents seem to prefer the flexibility of not being tied to an agreement. Research conducted in 2006 by Ibolya Losoncz, Senior Analyst, Family Payments & Policy Branch, Department of Families, Community Services & Indigenous Affairs (“Longitudinal study of children – data on families with child support entitlement”) found that: “The proportion of resident parents who reported not having a child support agreement was surprisingly high (…) We found that resident parents without an agreement tend to be a ‘mixed bag’. It included a sizable group of parents with shared care arrangements. It also included a group of older parents with high educational attainment and income who may have above average means to provide for their children and therefore are less likely to pursue a child support agreement. At the same time, this group had a relatively high proportion of parents with low socio-economic status, many of them of indigenous origin, reporting low educational attainment and income, and low attachment to the labour force. This raises the concern that a significant proportion of separated families who are already facing multiple disadvantages tend not to have an agreement to ensure that their children receive the financial support they are eligible to from their non-resident parent.” Parents can choose from two types of child support agreements under Part 6 of the CSAA – binding child support agreements or limited child support agreements. Binding child support agreements Section 80C sets out the technical requirements for an agreement to be binding. They mirror the requirements for a financial agreement",

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 37 Advantages and disadvantages of binding child support agreements You may be consulted about a binding child support agreement by your own client, or by someone else’s client for independent legal advice under s 80C(2) about its advantages and disadvantages and effect on their rights. In either case, it is suggested that you discuss with them: • any assessment made or, if none, an estimate of child support: – see “child support estimator” on the first page of this chapter • any misunderstanding about a binding agreement’s consequences • the prospect of having a limited child support agreement instead (see below) • any unequal bargaining power between the parties • that any change requires consent or a court finding “exceptional circumstances” In this statement from the former CSA website, advantages seem to merge with disadvantage: “Binding agreements are intended to provide a high level of certainty and finality about child support arrangements for parents. Legal advice is therefore required to ensure that parents understand the consequences of making such an agreement, and to provide some protection against coercive or misleading behaviour.” A binding agreement is bound to be an advantage to a payer wanting to lock the other party into an arrangement which will remain fixed, regardless of any future change in the parties’ needs or means that might render the agreement unfair. But what of the payee? Another advantage may be said to be the freedom to arrange one’s own affairs flexibly, although the use of non-periodic provision, such as school fees, and lump sum payments are available options to periodic child support under the Act without an agreement. The former CSA’s website stated that “due to the (stringent) requirements for ending a binding agree- ment, it is particularly important that binding agreements",

The former CSA’s website stated that “due to the (stringent) requirements for ending a binding agree- ment, it is particularly important that binding agreements are drafted in a way that takes account of the changing circumstances in which parents may find themselves”, yet the most careful drafting is unlikely to be able to make such an agreement both “final” and open to change. The former CSA itself “recognise[d] that it can be difficult to anticipate what will happen…into the future” (see below). Clauses such as for CPI or other increases are unlikely to resemble the parties’ unfolding financial reality. Even consent to renegotiate upon significant change of needs or means would require a court order if they could not agree when such a clause should be invoked. Ultimately, a person who does wish an account to be taken of changing circumstances is unlikely to be seeking a binding agreement in preference to a limited agreement that is specially designed for that purpose. Terminating binding child support agreements Binding child support agreements cannot be varied (s 80CA). Neither can limited child support agree- ments (s 80F). Binding agreements can, however, be terminated by a termination agreement, a new binding child support agreement or court order (s 80D). See “application to set aside child support agreement” below.

      "text": "CHAPTER FIVE 5 – 38 Limited child support agreements Limited agreements are more realistic as they may be brought to an end after three years if a party so wishes, or sooner in the case of a significant change of financial circumstances. They do have to be in writing, signed by both parents (s 80E) and lodged with the Child Support Regis- trar (to be enforceable), but separate legal advice is unnecessary. The requirements for a limited agree- ment are: • That there must be a child support assessment already in place • That the annual amount payable under the agreement must be equal to or more than the assessed annual amount Terminating limited child support agreements Section 80G enables limited child support agreements to be ended: • by making a new child support agreement replacing the agreement • by an order setting it aside (“application to set aside child support agreement” below) • if the notional assessment changes by more than 15% from the previous assessment, in a way not anticipated in the agreement, and one of the parents wants to end it Note – The Child Support Registrar is required, upon accepting a child support agreement, to make a “notional assessment” of the annual rate of child support that would be payable but for the agreement. That notional assessment enables parents to keep in touch with what would be payable, and is also used in the maintenance income test in working out a person’s rate of family tax benefit: Part 7A of the CSAA (s 146B). “This provides a safeguard, so that if circumstances change significantly the parties will not be locked into an agreement that does not reflect those new circumstances.” (former CSA website) • if more than three years has passed and written notice is given",

The suspension may apply for up to 26 weeks if the agreement provides for more than a 28 day suspension; the parties notify the Registrar within 26 weeks that they want a suspension for more than 28 days; or special circumstances are established (s 86(2)).

If that period lapses without such a resumption the agree- ment is terminated (ss 80D(2A) and 80G(1B)). See The Guide here at our eBook.

Both types of agreement must under s 81(2) comply with s 84 by containing at least one of these: • periodic child support • a variation of the rate at which a parent is already liable to pay periodic child support • any provision that may be included in a departure order by a court • a non-periodic provision (e.g. school fees), stating how it is to reduce the annual rate of child support payable under the child support assessment (if at all): ss 84(1)(d) and (6) • a lump sum payment (and any transfer or settlement of property), stating that it is to be credited against the liability under the assessment: ss 84(1)(e) and (7) Note – Agreements must also under that section comply with s 82 (made in relation to children entitled to an assessment) and s 83 (made between parties entitled to an assessment). For sample clauses, see “application for departure order” below under “precedents”. Form of agreement The DHS provides a form for this.

The form “child support agreement” (under “administrative forms” above) can either set out the agreement’s terms, or have the agreement attached to it. The form incorporates an application to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement. Note – You must attach to a binding child support agreement a lawyer’s certificate under s 80C CSAA.

A court can also make a stay order pending resolution of an objection under Part VII CSR&CA or the resolution of an application to the SSAT [now the AAT] under Part VIIA of that Act or matters under Part 6A or 7 of the Assessment Act. Prior to 1 July 2008 a stay order could only be made affecting the operation of the provision of the Assessment Act. As a result, stay orders could not be made in relation to the collection and disbursement powers of the Child Support Registrar under the Registration Act. After 1 July 2008, stay orders can address a specific collection action of the Child Support Registrar. For example, a stay order could: • order the Child Support Registrar to cease collecting from a payer’s salary; • order the Child Support Registrar to withdraw or modify a section 72A garnishment notice; • order the Child Support Registrar not to collect a payer’s taxation refund; • order the Child Support Registrar not to disburse monies held to the payee; or • order the Child Support Registrar to cease any and all administrative collection.

Child maintenance orders This is Division 7 of Part VII of the Family Law Act. Its object in s 66B of the FLA (to ensure a proper level of financial support of children by their parents having regard to their respective means) mirrors s 4(1) of the CSAA. And its principles under s 66C, as to a parent’s primary duty to maintain, are the same as in s 3 of the CSAA. In the case of step-children, a step-parent has a duty of maintaining the child, which is secondary to the primary duty of the child’s parents to maintain the child (provided that a court under s 66M determines that it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty): s 66D Payer not to prioritise between children of different relationships The Full Court held in Ganter & Grimshaw [1998] FamCA 52 that: • The effect of s 66C(2)(a) and (b) (as to priority of parents’ duty) is that a parent’s duty to maintain the children of one relationship has equal priority with the duty to maintain children of any subsequent relationship but is subservient to the primary duty of a parent to maintain himself or herself. • Equal priority between dependants does not necessarily equate to an equal division of the financial resources.

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 59 Balancing child’s needs with parent’s capacity to pay The Full Court in Mee & Ferguson [1986] FamCA 3 (FC) at [128] said: “[Counsel for the wife] challenged many of these items submitting that they were excessive or inappropriate...But the main thrust of (his) argument was that…it was incorrect in principle… to deduct from the husband’s income all of these expenses before considering the husband’s capacity to support his children. In our view counsel for the wife’s submission is clearly right. Some of the items obviously have to be taken into account before maintenance is arrived at; for example, the cost of reasonable transport, food and clothing, and other like expenses are necessary to the continued reasonable existence of a parent, and, barring legislative direction to the contrary, it would not accord with the understanding in this jurisdiction to suggest that those items should be put out of consideration before child maintenance is determined. On the other hand there is no doubt that one of the primary responsibilities of a parent is the continued support of children to the extent to which the parent continues to be able to do so and that may in appropriate circumstances mean making financial sacrifices or cutting one’s cloth to meet that commitment during the years when it applies.” Each party’s capacity to pay periodic maintenance to be considered first Section 66K(5) requires the court to consider this before any capacity of the parties to provide maintenance by way of lump sum payment; transfer of property; or in any other way.

A step-parent has the duty of maintaining a child if a court, by order under s 66M, determines it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty: s 66D(1). That duty is secondary to the primary duty of the child’s parents to maintain the child: s 66D(2) Section 66M confirms that a court may, by order, determine that it is proper for a step-parent to have a duty of maintaining a step-child; and in doing so is required to take into account: a) the matters referred to in ss 60F, 66B (proper level of support of children having regard to parents’ respective means) and 66C (parent’s primary duty to maintain) b) the length and circumstances of the marriage to the child’s parent c) the relationship that has existed between the step-parent and the child d) the arrangements that have existed for the maintenance of the child, and e) any special circumstances which, if not taken into account, would result in injustice or undue hardship to any person. An application for maintenance of stepchildren under s 66M must be coupled with an application for child maintenance under s 66F: Eames [2018] FamCAFC 204. Section 66N sets out the matters the court is to take into account when determining the amount of maintenance that should be paid by a step-parent. What to file?

Specify maintenance component of any order for lump sum or property transfer Section 66R of the FLA requires the court in any order for payment of a lump sum or transfer of property, all or part of which is intended as child maintenance, to specify: • that Section 66R applies to the order • the child for whom maintenance was being provided by the payment or transfer • the portion of the payment, or the value of the portion of the property, attributable to the provision of maintenance Modification of child maintenance orders Section 66S of the FLA provides for this. Should you come across such a matter, your quickest route to the section is to copy and download it from the Family Law Act in www.austlii.edu.au You will find that the grounds and procedure are similar to applications to vary a spousal maintenance order (see “variation of spousal maintenance orders” in the chapter “spousal maintenance”).

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 65 COLLECTION OF CHILD SUPPORT AND CHILD MAINTENANCE Child support and child maintenance can be collected by the Child Support Registrar under s 30 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act (CSR&CA) but “more than 60% of newly separated par- ents in 2006–2007 chose (private collect) because it’s flexible: you and the other parent work out the payment arrangements that best suit you and the children” (former Child Support Agency’s website). Our eBook on this page has a link to “CSA [Child Support] collection” and to “child support private collect” dealing with putting the arrangement in writing; setting up private payments; deciding on any in-kind (third party) payments; and asking the Child Support Registrar to start collecting payments (by lodging a “request to change payment collection method”) if private payments do not work out. The Act allows the Child Support Registrar to credit lump sum payments (s 69A), payments made direct to payee (s 71), third party payments (s 71A) and payments in kind (s 71B), and to offset debts between payer and payee (s 71AA). A debt under a child support agreement may be enforced in the FCFCA or FCWA once it has been registered there (see “child support agreements” above). Amounts payable under an assessment, court order or registered maintenance agreement are debts due to the Commonwealth, once the liability is registered with the Registrar under the Act (s 30). “Registrable maintenance liabilities” are defined in ss 17, 17A, 18 and 18A and include a court order for spousal maintenance (s 18). Money owed may be sued for and recovered by the Registrar (which, since August 2011, has had the option of outsourcing recovery to debt collection agencies) or, if a payee wishes to do so, by a payee in a",

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 67 COURT PROCEDURE AND FORMS FOR CHILD SUPPORT MATTERS In some scenarios a parent or carer can apply to the court for relief directly without going through the administrative departure process. In all other cases, however, they must first pursue administrative review as a prerequisite to their having standing to bring a matter to court. It follows that before bringing any court application, it is vital for a lawyer to review whether the client has standing to bring such an application or not. For more information see The Child Support Guide. Court procedure is governed by FLR 1.13 and, in WA, para 11 of the FCWA’s Case Management Guidelines. When can a party apply directly to the court? A parent may apply directly to the court as follows: 1. To apply for a declaration under ss 106A or 107 that a parent should or should not be assessed because they are or are not a parent of the child (“paternity disputes” above) 2. To seek a departure order where an assessment is in place and one of the following applies: • the parents are already parties to court proceedings, such as property settlement or enforcement matters • the Registrar has refused to change the assessment as the matter is too complex • the AAT has refused to make a Part 6A determination as to the assessment 3. To apply for child support in a form other than periodic amounts or to vary such an order 4. To apply for an order setting aside a child support agreement (accepted by the Registrar) 5. To apply for a stay of proceedings 6. To appeal to a court from the AAT on a question of law 7. To apply for leave to amend an old assessment (between",

Such an order allows the Registrar to amend the assessment to take into account new information, while continuing to give effect to the order. See below for some examples of such clauses. Varying a parent’s adjusted taxable income Note – Such an order can now apply to both parties. It may raise income to a truer amount, having regard to real income or access to resources, or reduce it where capital is being spent to pay high expenses. Once the income is set, however, the parties can no longer lodge income estimates. Final order 1.

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 77 Setting a parent’s child support income Note – An order can set or vary a parent’s child support income by means of the same order above for “varying a parent’s adjusted taxable income” but substituting “child support income” for “adjusted taxable income”. This clause may be appropriate if the formula assessment does not accurately reflect current income(s) and allows for care changes to be reflected. A parent’s “child support income” reflects the resources they have available to support the children, after the self-support amount and any relevant dependent child amount has been deducted. If a parent’s resources are not accurately reflected in the assessment, it would normally be more appropriate to set or vary the parent’s “adjusted taxable income” (as in the earlier clause above), unless there is a specific desire to adjust the calculation of the resources available to support the children, instead of the parent’s total resources. Again, by setting the child support income, a parent cannot lodge income estimates. Varying the child support percentage Note – An order can adjust the amount payable by increasing or decreasing a parent’s child support percentage. Since 1 July 2008, a parent’s child support percentage is the share of the cost that the parent must transfer to the other parent. Also, varying the child support percentage does not increase the overall cost of the children. Where, for example, the parents agree that the special needs of the children require a parent to contribute a higher level of child support than is normally payable under the formula, it would be easier and more transparent to adjust another formula component, such as changing the cost of the child to reflect this (see below). It should also be noted that varying one parent’s child support percentage may",

It should also be noted that varying one parent’s child support percentage may have anomalous effects, depending on the other parent’s circumstances. It changes the share of the cost that one parent must transfer to the other, but in a somewhat artificial way. A parent’s child support percentage is the result of subtracting the parent’s cost percentage (share of costs that they bear directly, if any) from their income percentage (their share of the combined resources). It would usually be easier and more transparent to adjust the parents’ income percentages and/or cost percentages, leaving the child support percentages to be calculated automatically from these new figures. You should contact the Child Support Registrar for further information if you are considering inserting such a clause. Varying the costs of the children Note – An order can adjust the costs of children used in the formula. This recognises that the cost of the children, or a particular child, is higher or lower than the usual costs. They may be higher, for example, if the child has special needs or if school fees are high. Adjusting the costs of the children (rather than another element of the formula or the amount payable) will automatically distribute these additional costs between parents according to their share of the avail- able resources (income percentages). So it is not necessary to separately establish the payer’s share and add this to the amount payable. If for some reason it is appropriate for the paying parent to bear all the additional cost, for example, because they have agreed to meet all school",

If the costs are high because the child has special needs requiring modification to the houses, this is likely to be the case. If the costs are high due to school fees and one parent actually pays the total amount to the school, this is not likely to be the case. The cost percentages (share of the cost that each parent meets directly) used in the assessment are also likely to require adjustment in such a case (see below). It may instead be preferable to adjust the annual rate to recognise one parent’s share of the additional cost borne by the other parent. Final order 1.

This will ensure that if a terminating event (s 12) occurs in relation to one or more of the children, only the cost or increase per child will continue to be used, rather than the full cost or increase stipulated in the order. Varying the cost percentage Note – The formula in effect, from 1 July 2008, works out the share of the child’s costs that each parent is meeting directly, according to their share of the care, as set out in the table in s 55C. In some cases, the share of the cost that each parent meets directly may be significantly different from the figures in this table. For example, parents may have shared care, and be assessed as each meeting 50% of the child’s costs directly, but one parent may be paying all of the school fees or medical costs. It may be appropriate to vary the cost percentages in such a situation. This kind of variation would often be used in conjunction with a variation to the cost of the child. Parents may also choose to agree that they each meet 50% of the child’s costs, for example, although their care is not exactly equal. Final order 1.

If the variation to the cost percentages is relevant for only one child, the court order or agreement should specify this. It is advisable to use percentage point variations, rather than varying the percentage by X%. Decreasing 50% by 10% could be interpreted as resulting in either 40% (reduction of 10 percentage points) or 45% (reduction of 10% of 50%). A child’s income Note – Under the CSAA, a child remains an eligible child for a child support assessment until their 18th birthday: s 12(1)(c). Where the child’s secondary education continues beyond that day, the assessment can be extended to the last day they receive secondary education in the school year of their 18th birthday, if an application to extend the assessment is received before they turn 18 (ss 151B, 151C and 151D). The Child Support Registrar cannot end a child support assessment because of the income earned by an eligible child, but a court can make a departure order that varies the assessment for that child if it believes that it is just and equitable to change the assessment because of the child’s income, earning capacity or financial resources: s 117(2)(c)(i) Also, if a child’s income is significant, that may indicate that a terminating event has occurred because the parents may cease to be eligible carers (ss 12 and 7B).

SCHOOL FEES) Note – The Act does not limit the types of provision that can be included, but the most common are school fees, mortgage payments, health insurance and the costs of orthodontic treatment. The payments may reduce, or be in addition to, the child support payable (the former Child Support Agency website, which also suggested the following form of orders). Editor’s note – Either party can apply for this – the payer, so that the payer’s payment of these third party expenses is credited against the assessed child support (or rationalised with a manageable amount for monthly child support, as covered by the second set of orders below) OR the payee, so that the payer’s payment of those expenses is over and above the assessed child support. The sample affidavit supplied will cover the usual scenario of a payer wishing to rationalise the payment the payer is making. If a payee is applying, simply adapt the sample to the payee’s needs. For your order to be enforceable by Child Support document it instead as a departure order so that it forms part of the child support assessment. Final orders Payments to third parties 1.

This application has more to do with one-off lump sum payments or transfers of property for the benefit of a child than s 124’s provision for ongoing non-periodic third party payments such as school fees. The application is more likely to relate to a lump sum payment for a single child, although a lump sum payment or a transfer of property may also be made for the benefit of more than one child. The sample affidavit in support below assumes a single child. Child Support’s treatment of lump sum payments The lump sum must equal or exceed the annual rate of child support payable for the child under the assessment: s 123A(1)(c). The section itself notes that if the court makes such an order, the lump sum is treated as an advance payment and does not reduce the annual child support payable under the assessment. Final orders Lump sum payment 1.

As this section is similar to s 77 for spousal maintenance, see “urgent maintenance orders” in the chapter “spousal maintenance”.

If a child applies for an order against one parent, that parent could join the other parent as second respondent enabling an order to be made against both parents as occurred in Re: AM (Adult Child Maintenance) (see Case Table).

In effect, the parent will be assessed as having a relevant dependent child (which, under s 5 of the CSAA includes a child for whom such an order is in force), and will therefore have a relevant dependent child amount deducted from their adjusted taxable income when the Registrar calculates child support for their other child support children.

An order under s 66M means that the step-parent has a legal duty to maintain the step-child. Should he or she separate from their spouse (the parent of the step-child) they may be required to pay child maintenance for the step-child. The order can be registered with the Child Support Registrar for collection as it is a “registrable maintenance liability” within the meaning of s 17(1) of the CSR&CA. If a person has a legal duty to maintain a step-child (because they are a relevant dependent child due to an order under s 66M) they may be able to seek a further adjustment of their child support assessment if their step-child has special needs that affect their capacity to financially support their child support children (ss 98B, 98C and 117(2)(a)(ii)).

      "text": "CHILD SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE 5 – 107 APPLICATION FOR CHILD-BEARING EXPENSES OF UNMARRIED MOTHER Note – Such an application is quite rare, and not surprisingly, as an applicant’s legal costs are likely to be disproportionate to the amount of the claim. If one is brought, file it no sooner than three months after and no later than 12 months after the birth. This is because maintenance (of the mother) is recoverable for up to three months after the birth (see “child-bearing expenses of unmarried mothers” above) and s 67G applies a time limit of 12 months for applying). The father is liable under s 67B(a) to contribute to the maintenance of the mother for that period in relation to the birth of the child, so your client’s affidavit will need to be able to identify pregnancy- or birth-related expenses that are not covered by child support (CSAA) or medical expenses (s 67B(b)), both of which are separate, additional entitlements. The “childbirth maintenance period” begins on the day the mother stops working (if doing so more than two months before the due date, on doctor’s advice related to the pregnancy) or, in any other case, two months before the due date. Final orders sought 1. That the Respondent [full name] pay to the Applicant [full name] $[amount] per week for her maintenance for the childbirth maintenance period in relation to the birth of the child due to be born to the parties on [date]. 2. That the childbirth maintenance period for the purposes of this order [if the Applicant works in paid employment; and is advised by a doctor to stop working for medical reasons related to her pregnancy; and stops working after being so advised and more than two months before the child is due to be born] is the",

Nygh J said in Eliades [1980] FamCA 7 at [3]: “ … [T]he test of ability to support oneself is not identical to the test of whether one is in need but means whether the applicant is in a position to finance himself or herself from his or her own resources.

The court may grant leave to apply out of time on the same grounds as for spousal maintenance above: s 44(6) Both types of maintenance This time limit does not apply to applications under s 83 or s 90SI to vary, revive, suspend or discharge an order: subsection (3) Nor does it apply for a maintenance application brought where previous maintenance orders have been satisfied: see Blevins [2019] FCCA 1923 which discusses the authorities. See “property” chapter (under “time limit”) for applications for leave to extend time. Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

      "text": "SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 6 – 5 DECLARATION ABOUT EXISTENCE OF DE FACTO RELATIONSHIP This can be a preliminary issue in a de facto case. It is usually raised by a respondent who, by seeking an interim declaration under s 90RD FLA, disputes the applicant’s right to maintenance orders. (In WA a respondent must seek an interim order dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction under s 205Z FCA. If the court does lack jurisdiction it may still award costs: FCR 11.1.) See “de facto maintenance claims” above as to the right to bring such a claim. A person is in a “de facto relationship” with another person if they are not married or related to each other and, having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a cou- ple living together on a genuine domestic basis: s 4AA(1) (in WA s 13A Interpretation Act 1984 (WA)). A “de facto relationship” includes same sex partners and can exist if a partner is married to someone else or is in another de facto relationship: s 4AA(5). Under s 4AA(2) those circumstances may include: • length of the relationship • ownership, use and acquisition of property • nature and extent of their common residence • degree of mutual commitment to a shared life • whether a sexual relationship exists • care and support of children • degree of financial dependence and support • reputation and public aspects of the relationship • whether the relationship is or was registered e.g. under Relationships Act (Tas & Vic), Civil Part- nerships Act (ACT & Qld) and Relationships Register Act (NSW and SA) A declaration may be sought under s 90RD (for WA see the 1st para above) that a de facto relationship of at least two years existed or did not",

      "text": "CHAPTER SIX 6 – 6 URGENT MAINTENANCE ORDERS Section 77 provides that: “Where, in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage, it appears to the court that the party is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not practicable in the circumstances to determine immediately what order, if any, should be made, the court may order the payment, pending the disposal of the proceedings, of such periodic sum or other sums as the Court considers reasonable.” Note – The equivalent section for de facto claims is s 90SG. Nygh J in Ashton [1982] FamCA 9 said at [4]-[6]: “An application (for urgent maintenance) is heard at a time when all the evidence is not yet to hand…an application for interim maintenance must not be confused with an application for urgent maintenance…an application for interim maintenance can only be heard after each party has had the opportunity to adduce evidence (by) the filing of affidavits by both parties and the financial statements.” Watson SJ held in Malcolm [1977] FamCA 27 at [12] that the wife who continued to live in the home rent-free, had a part-time job and $6,000 was not in immediate need of financial assistance: “Section 77…is to provide emergency funding in those cases where the Court is unable to determine immediately what order should be made.” Urgent maintenance was refused in Grimshaw-Grieves & Grieves [2011] FMCAfam 125 as the appli- cant had bank savings of $17,300. Fogarty J has described s 77 as being “aimed at orders in circumstances of relieving pressing… need, and is determined on a rather pragmatic basis without any real hearing upon the merits. It is in the nature of a stop-gap order…for a short, ordinarily definitive period of time”: Williamson [1978] FamCA 57. This “stop-gap” nature",

This “stop-gap” nature was illustrated in Dein [1989] FamCA 19 where urgent spousal maintenance of $250 per week was awarded for five weeks. Such an order enables the parties to file their material and proceed to an interim (or final) maintenance hearing on the merits. Urgent applicants must establish a right to maintenance under s 72: Gyopar [1986] FamCA 64. Note – Due to its short life, an application for urgent maintenance is rarely a good idea. Applicants can usually apply quickly for interim maintenance, completing a Financial Statement and a short affidavit of evidence as to the reason for it (see “procedure for maintenance applications” below). If you must apply for urgent maintenance, an application to the FCFCA with a short affidavit as to why it is sought is enough (no Financial Statement is necessary). If you struggle with it, however, you will not be allowed to re-label it an interim maintenance application: see Ashton (above). Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

For an example of how interim maintenance applications are dealt with, see the decision of Wicklow [2007] FamCA 792, where Judicial Registrar Johnston heard a matter where the wife sought interim spousal maintenance of $4,264 per month. In this case: • the wife’s ownership of shares in her own name worth $110,000 did not bar her from being awarded spousal maintenance; • the finding that she had not worked full-time for 24 years, but had a working capacity of 2.5 days a week as a design consultant, did not affect her maintenance claim either; • the husband was found to have an earning capacity of $2–300,000 per annum; • the husband, who alleged no capacity to pay, was found to have had funds to pay for rent on a waterfront apartment, recent overseas travel, and subscriptions to various sporting clubs. After assessing which of the parties’ claimed expenses were reasonable, the Court held: “In circumstances where the husband has control of his income, control of a considerable amount of property of the parties…then in my view the Court should not be shy about making…an order (for interim) spousal maintenance. The task at the present time is one in which the Court does not have to be too particular about making findings…especially where there will be ample opportunity for the Court to consider the matter in greater detail in a substantive (the final) hearing.” The wife’s reasonable needs were found to be $3,200 per month and an interim order for spousal maintenance was made for that amount.

In Kitman [2007] FamCA 822, a husband on appeal to the Full Court won: • a reduction of interim maintenance from $660 to $110 per week due to his expenses (which properly included his payments towards a joint mortgage) • the halving of an interim lump sum award of $2,000 due to scant evidence of the wife’s immediate need An example of an interim order for periodic maintenance on top of an interim property settlement was Oates & Crest [2008] FamCAFC 29 where the husband of a judicial officer was granted $107,000 towards legal costs ($80,000); rental of “superior accommodation until the final hearing” ($30,000); furniture and household items ($14,000). As it was found that “the husband would be left with little or nothing of the $107,000 from which to support himself” after payment of such “debts and other reason- able expenses” (paras 33, 37–8), an order was made for his “reasonable weekly needs” until the final hearing in the sum of $984 per week. For a review of the relevant law, see Rainsford [2010] FMCAfam 231. Partial property settlement before interim maintenance The Full Court in Oates & Crest also held that interim (or partial) property settlement should be determined first, so that the need for interim periodic maintenance may be assessed in light of what lump sum provision had been made.

      "text": "CHAPTER SIX 6 – 8 MAINTENANCE FACTORS The matters to be taken into account under s 75(2) (and s 90SF(3) for de facto claims) are: (a) the age and state of health of each party Age Age is often raised as a factor for wives after a long absence from the workforce. It has been said of a 57-year-old wife working three days a week as a part-time shop assistant that despite the absence of “evidence about lack of training for employment, reduced health or mobility or other factors…(the court) can take judicial notice that 60 is the normal age of retirement for women and that it may be difficult for women approaching that age to retain or obtain full-time employment”: Nygh J in Atwill [1981] FamCA 72 at [21]. See the Full Court’s use of published research on “the feminisation of poverty” in Mitchell [1995] FamCA 32 at [76]. But see B & B [2002] FMCAfam 439 at [21]-[25] where it was held, despite W’s age (59), that medical and other evidence was necessary to prove mental incapacity for employment. Age combined with serious ill health can substantially favour a maintenance applicant: Zubcic [1995] FamCA 143, about a 60-year-old man disabled in an industrial accident. On the other hand, it was held in Richardson [1979] FamCA 7 at [47] that “a considerable qualification to [a respondent’s] earning capacity is his age [which was 62]”, although the Court should also consider the respondent’s entitlement to significant superannuation at age 65. Health Shock suffered by a young wife at the end of her marriage worsened a pre-existing illness to such an extent as to render her unable to work: Tye (No. 2) [1976] FamCA 30.

She was also awarded lump sum main- tenance, upheld by the Full Court as a proper replenishment of capital spent on medical expenses. A wife with multiple sclerosis was awarded a property settlement and lump sum spousal maintenance by way of the transfer to her of the home, which was suitable for her needs, not having stairs and being close to transport and shops: Dow-Sainter [1980] FamCA 60. See also W & W [1997] FamCA 3 where the Full Court held that the wife’s state of health: “resulted in her having a need for a dwelling constructed of low maintenance materials, her need for special care and paid housekeeping assistance, a car and other special items”. An unemployed 53-year-old wife with past experience as a hairdresser called her GP whose evidence that she was overweight, suffered joint pain in her hands and knees and was unfit for full-time work was accepted by Roberts FM in A & A [2003] FMCAfam 216.

See also H & H [2003] FMCAfam 471 where Raphael FM dismissed the maintenance claim of a 47-year-old wife who was found to have a heart complaint but to have exaggerated her claimed disability and not met her obligation of seeking out work that, according to her doctor’s evidence, she was capable of undertaking. Her admission to being a regular bowler (of which her doctor was unaware) did not help her case. The court rejected a husband’s claim of incapacity for other employment due to profound hearing loss in both ears, and limited command of English, finding that he had been “continuously employed as a process worker (for) many years…was otherwise in good health…and was likely (to) continue in employment in the foreseeable future”: Penza [1988] FamCA 37 at [57].

An applicant is not disqualified by having a partial earning capacity: Kajewski [1978] FamCA 62. Respondent’s income In DJM & JLM [1998] FamCA 97 where a doctor reduced his income the Full Court said at [17.50]: “A judge might accept that it is unreasonable to expect a parent to continue to work 80 hours per week whilst having obligations to care for one child, and whilst that parent is still earning more than sufficient for his or her own needs and the needs of that parent’s children. Alternatively, a judge might conclude, based on a proven work history, that such a work pattern is entirely reason- able in the circumstances. Ultimately the matter reverts to the exercise of discretion by the trial judge based on the individual circumstances of the case … ” Property The Full Court said in Bevan [1993] FamCA 95 at [43]: “ … [W]e do not think that the law requires that a wife should deplete an already comparatively meagre capital sum [from the property settlement], to enable a much higher earning husband to avoid his obligation to maintain a former spouse who is in financial circumstances such as those in which she finds herself”. However, an applicant’s savings of $87,000 (not from a property settlement) have been held to be relevant: Padnall [2014] FamCAFC 145 at [34]-[38].

In Kiesinger & Paget [2008] FamCAFC 23 at [27] an “imbalance in … capital resources … was a relevant consideration … [as to interim maintenance]”.

Financial resources Were defined by Fogarty J in Crapp [1979] FamCA 17 as “a source of financial support which a party can reasonably expect will be available to him or her to supply a financial need or deficiency”.

The husband’s proceeds of sale of a taxi spent on himself and partly for the children was added back to the asset pool notionally by the Full Court as a financial resource: Townsend [1994] FamCA 144. Also, a husband who brought about his own incapacity for self-support by spending a damages award instead of investing it was refused maintenance: Berta [1988] FamCA 33. A payee was held to be obligated to maximise his return on his investments: Bassingthwaite & Leane [1993] FamCA 86. Trust beneficiaries The interest of a party as beneficiary of a discretionary trust has been held to be a financial resource where it was found that the party: • had actual control over the trust’s assets: Tiley [1980] FamCA 73 and Kelly (No. 2) [1981] FamCA 78 • could compel the trustee’s discretion in her favour: Whitehead [1979] FamCA 41 • had no control but a reasonable expectation of benefiting: Bailey [1978] FamCA 20 However, in another case where a husband had no control over the trust assets or income a trust interest was excluded from consideration because the children held the shares that created most rights to income and capital: Yates (No. 2) [1982] FamCA 11.

      "text": "CHAPTER SIX 6 – 12 Court dismisses maintenance claim of wife wanting to retrain The Full Court in M & M (McCrossen) [2006] FamCA 868 heard expert evidence adduced by the husband that the wife (who wanted to train as a teacher) could return to employment in the public service after ten weeks of training. The wife’s evidence was that she had made no inquiries as she was not interested in doing that kind of work again. The Court (Bryant CJ, Finn and Coleman JJ) held that the trial judge, Hannon J, was correct in holding that the wife had the onus of satisfying the provisions of s 72 and in not being satisfied that the wife was unable to maintain herself adequately. The Court at [46] said: “We are satisfied that…the considerations the Full Court in Mitchell [1995] FamCA 32 was concerned with, such as lack of experience, being out of the skilled workforce for years and high unemployment rates, (were) not apposite in this case where there was evidence that the wife had refused to contemplate or enquire into part time work commensurate with her past experience, and which on a reasonable enquiry…would be available to her…after a relatively short period of re-training.” Disputing an applicant’s alleged inability to support themselves The court in this case accepted the evidence of the manager of a recruitment agency (adduced by the respondent) that the wife’s qualifications, experience and skills were such that, after 10 weeks of training, part-time employment would be available to the wife, at an expected wage of about $495 per week (see “precedents” below for a sample affidavit).

Para (e) is “couched in wide terms and ought to be given a broad interpre- tation”: Full Court in Soblusky [1976] FamCA 90 at [86] which added that “[a] court is required under para (e) to consider in a realistic way the fact that a party has assumed a responsibility to support another person, and the weight to be given to that fact depends upon the circumstances of each individual case”. The Court refused to assume that a responsibility to a spouse was higher than to any other person such as a spouse or children of a second marriage. The relevant authori- ties are summarised in Brown [2007] FamCA 151 at [117]-[122].

The court has long held that the standard of living to which an applicant was accustomed must be considered in determining whether maintenance is adequate: Goldstein J in Evans [1978] FamCA 23; Murray J in Kutcher [1978] FamCA 31 (“…wife is entitled to live in comfort in an area reasonably close to where she has established herself”); Full Court in Olliver [1978] FamCA 24 (“…wife’s standard of living will govern the (children’s)”; Nygh J in Aroney [1979] FamCA 62 “[W] is entitled to live in quiet comfort…”); Full Court in Tiley [1980] FamCA 73 (“a standard of living…nearer to that to which…she was accustomed”); Full Court in Beck (No. 2) [1983] FamCA 7 (“…not at the standard she previously enjoyed, but in reasonable comfort”). Lindenmayer J has found “no basis (for concluding) that the welfare of these children calls for any sig- nificant reduction in their present standard of living” where the court had regard to the activities of the children and their parents’ expectations for them: Campbell [1987] FamCA 68.

The Full Court, however, has said of the section that “the ‘clean break’ concept may have been taken to extremes in the past and requires careful reconsideration in the light of changing economic and social circumstances and values”: Best [1993] FamCA 107 at [126]. Where awarded on top of a property order, spousal maintenance is usually limited to a specific period: D & D (Unrep) [2003] FamCA 1356 at [79] (9 months + 2 months until payment of property settlement); Matthews [1980] FamCA 18 (lump sum to cover 2 years transition “to make decisions and arrange investments”); Vautin [1998] FamCA 135 (lump sum “to meet inevitable but reasonable expenditure for her own support in the next few years”). Maintenance for an unlimited period was awarded in Kearney [1990] FamCA 159; Bevan [1993] FamCA 95; Ramsay [1997] FamCA 4; and Bucknell [2009] FamCAFC 177 at [53]-[56].

      "text": "CHAPTER SIX 6 – 18 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY ORDERS The Full Court in Clauson [1995] FamCA 10, referring to a long line of authority, made it clear that where spousal maintenance and a property order are sought, spousal maintenance is to be dealt with after the determination of property settlement. In Clauson it was held that the property settlement in favour of the wife was so substantial as to afford her a capital sum and investment opportunities that would prevent her from demonstrating that she would be unable to support herself adequately. The Full Court in Mitchell [1995] FamCA 32 held that the property order in favour of the wife should not disqualify her from maintenance. The Full Court held in Bevan [1993] FamCA 95 that a wife is not required to deplete capital she could use to buy a home, when the husband’s higher income was available to pay her a weekly amount towards her living expenses. The Court held that the trial judge, in dealing with spousal maintenance in isolation from the property settlement, had not done justice to both parties. The periodic sum awarded for maintenance was reduced and lump sum maintenance was declined. Spousal maintenance should be determined after any child support issues: see, for example Anderson [2014] FamCA 766 at [21]-[22]. Property means “existing property … and does not extend to property that might be received in the future” such that an order obliging a husband to pay the wife’s future outgoings was a spousal mainte- nance order: Thorpe & Stirling [2021] FedCFamC1A 86 at [26].

BACKDATED MAINTENANCE ORDERS The Full Court in Milankov [2002] FamCA 195 (Nicholson CJ and Buckley J at [31], and Kay J at [91]-[102]) upheld Penny J’s backdating of maintenance, as being within the court’s power in respect of spousal maintenance. The trial judge had rejected the wife’s claim for lump sum maintenance (as no source of funds had been identified as being able to meet that order) but had had regard to the husband’s ability to pay over the previous 32 months of non-payment (during the court proceedings) and the wife’s need for maintenance in that time, in making a retrospective order for periodic maintenance at $300 per week for that period. That order created arrears of $36,100 which were ordered to be paid within 90 days. The court also made an order for a reduced figure of $200 weekly for prospective maintenance.

      "text": "SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 6 – 19 LUMP SUM ORDERS The Court’s power to make lump sum orders comes from s 80(1)(a) and the wide discretion under s 74 (ss 90SS(1)(a) and 90SE respectively for de facto claims) to make such order as the Court “considers proper” for the provision of spousal maintenance. The Full Court in Clauson [1995] FamCA 10 held that: • property settlement must be dealt with before spousal maintenance, and • it is necessary to determine periodic maintenance first before lump sum maintenance, lump sum maintenance being the capitalisation of the periodic maintenance conclusion. The Court held that before lump sum maintenance can be awarded, the court must first satisfy itself of the components necessary to justify a periodic award, i.e. need and capacity, and determine the amount in question and the duration of that order. If those components are not established “that will end any claim for not only periodic maintenance but lump sum maintenance as well”. Limits of dependency Evatt CJ in Spano [1979] FamCA 43 held that (provided there are funds available to meet such an order) a lump sum order should not be made unless it is “possible to assess with some certainty the limits of the dependency of the recipient of the order, either as to the period or as to the amount”. Examples of limited dependency were given as: • short dependency when children were about to leave school • dependency until the wife’s return to the workforce • the wife having some earning capacity, though not sufficient to meet her full needs • the need to undergo a training course • a husband with limited means who could forgo some of his property award as lump sum maintenance For assessments of dependency see Bolton and Dow-Sainter, under (a) (“health”) above.

Lump sum maintenance was not payable by a convict as he had no ability to pay periodic maintenance: Re Q [1994] FamCA 158. But in Plut [1987] FamCA 52 the Full Court held that the husband’s earn- ing capacity was not likely to be reduced in retirement; that the wife’s incapacity for self-support “will probably extend well beyond her 61st year”; and that the trial judge’s chosen period for capitalisation of maintenance should be extended accordingly. See also Vartikian (No. 2) [1984] FamCA 63 where Gee J cited Rayden on Divorce to the effect that no lump sum award should be made unless the husband has capital assets out of which to pay it without crippling his earning power. When he has available capital assets sufficient for the purpose, the court: “should not hesitate to award a lump sum. The wife will then be able to invest and use the income to live off. This will reduce any periodical payments or make them unnecessary, which will also help to remove the bitterness which is often attended upon periodical payments.” See Milankov (above under “backdated maintenance orders”) where, although there was no fund from which lump sum maintenance could be ordered to be paid, an order for periodic maintenance was made retrospectively; creating arrears of maintenance which were ordered to be paid within 90 days.

The husband was $24,400 in arrears of that maintenance despite the improvement of his means (to about $2m). The wife applied for lump sum maintenance of $250,000. She called medical witnesses to support her case that she was unable to be employed. It was ordered that the hus- band pay those arrears and varied periodic maintenance by awarding the wife $500 per week and $250 per week and education expenses for each of the then 3 children, aged 23, 20 and 18 during their tertiary and secondary education. The claim for lump sum maintenance was ad- journed as it was not then ready to proceed. A lump sum order was eventually made. The Full Court dismissed the husband’s appeal against the award of lump sum maintenance of $97,000 and allowed the wife’s cross-appeal by increasing her award to $136,000. The majority of Fogarty and Burton JJ (at [56]) said that this was: “a very unusual case...(in favour of) an additional lump sum for the wife to provide her with some capital to meet inevitable non-periodic but reasonable expenditure for her own support in the next few years. The likelihood of necessary expenditure of this type was not really challenged, nor was the husband’s capacity to meet such an order. The issue was whether her own meagre resources were sufficient.” $9,000 was added to the trial judge’s award, so as to allow the full net cost of a replacement motor vehicle for the wife instead of part",

The issue was whether her own meagre resources were sufficient.” $9,000 was added to the trial judge’s award, so as to allow the full net cost of a replacement motor vehicle for the wife instead of part of that cost. A further $30,000 was awarded, which was said ([57]) to be “modest compared with the husband’s position but may be sufficient to meet the inevitable additional expenses of the wife involved in a reasonable standard for her over the next few years.” The trial judge’s award of $97,000, which had been for the replacement of white goods ($10,000) and furnishings ($12,000), $15,000 for part of the cost of a new car (that award increased to $24,000) and $60,000 (increased to $90,000) for home repairs and renovations, was increased overall by $39,000 from $97,000 to $136,000. The wife’s further claim of $50,000 for “the future vicissitudes of life” was declined, as was her claim (as an alternative to the cost of home repairs) of $150,000 to buy a new home. Finn, J (dissenting) disagreed, however, dismissing both the appeal and cross-appeal. This case is an example of: • a spousal maintenance order being increased 8 years later • the increase taking the form of a lump sum • the applicant’s case being improved by her losing her earning capacity, and the improvement of the husband’s circumstances • how judges can disagree about whether to vary a maintenance order Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

      "text": "SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 6 – 21 In a 2006 case, the Full Court adopted the broad approach taken by the majority in Vautin, who sought to stress “the wide discretion available…to a trial judge when making a spousal maintenance order, and to emphasise the flexibility, available in an appropriate case, to make a lump sum order”: JS and GP [2006] FamCA 150 at [151]. (The court said that as there was no question of maintenance default on the part of the husband, periodic payments were more appropriate than a lump sum payment: [152].) Also see Vault & Isle [2012] FamCAFC 93 where Kaeser AM’s dismissal of the wife’s maintenance ap- plication on the ground that the husband had complied with an earlier order to pay maintenance of $28,000 by instalments was set aside by Thackray J who said at [29] that s 80(2) FLA (allowing a subse- quent maintenance order to be made) appeared to have been “simply overlooked”. Murphy J held in Bereat [2010] FamCA 693 at [103]-[104], applying s 80(1)(a) and Vautin (above) that despite the Full Court’s preference for periodic orders over lump sum orders (Clauson [1995] FamCA 10) a payment of $13,000 to the wife was “proper” within the meaning of s 74(1) to enable “the pursuit of a course that will allow a sole-parent to pursue employment with hours more regular than those under which she currently labours”. A further $15,000 was awarded as the discounted capitali- sation of $400 per week (assessed as the wife’s needs) for the duration of the 45 week course having regard to the husband’s “peripatetic lifestyle in overseas countries” and “significant potential difficulties for the wife in securing regular payments of maintenance from the husband”.

SPECIFICATION OF SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE COMPONENT OF PROPERTY ORDERS Section 77A(1) (and s 90SH) says that an order for payment of lump sum maintenance, or the transfer of property all or part of which is to provide for the maintenance of a party, must: • state that it is an order to which this section applies; and • specify the amount or value of the maintenance provision. A property settlement order containing but not specifying a maintenance component shall be taken not to be for the maintenance of a party: see subsection (2). Kay J in Doig [1999] FamCA 1363 at [23] referred to s 77A as being “designed to protect the revenue”, by requiring those receiving maintenance by way of a capital payment to be as accountable for Centrelink’s income-testing of pensions as those receiving maintenance income. The Court there dismissed the husband’s claim that the trial judge had erred by specifying a portion of the wife’s property settlement as a s 77A maintenance provision. Kay J on behalf of the Full Court held that although the specification may have been incorrect (the trial judge having held that the wife had no maintenance claim on top of her property settlement), it did not prejudice either party.

      "text": "SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 6 – 23 For a useful summary of the meaning of “just cause” for the discharge of a maintenance order, see Pratt [2012] FamCAFC 81 at [96]-[98]. A husband successfully sought the discharge of a maintenance order made at the time of the parties’ property settlement: Bastow [2009] FMCAfam 21. He called a doctor and a recruitment consultant to counter the wife’s case, also annexing to his affidavit the “Westpac-AFSA Retirement Standard for ‘a comfortable lifestyle’ for a single female in Tasmania”, of which the court found the wife’s claimed expenses were “well in excess”. In Dalrymple [2009] FMCAfam 931 a 2004 maintenance order and arrears thereunder were dis- charged when it was found ([110]) that the applicant had “no recurrent or reliable source of income from which to satisfy the order”. In Priddle & Ors (No. 2) [2009] FMCAfam 876 an interim mainte- nance order was discharged due to “a major change” of the applicant’s financial circumstances. For a review of case law as to the discharge of a spousal maintenance order, see Cooper & Kingsley [2013] FCCA 277 at [16]-[18] and [23]-[29]. It was held in Caska [2001] FamCA 1279 that a maintenance order, once satisfied (paid out) was incapable of variation under s 83 but in Vault & Isle [2012] FamCAFC 93 at [21]-[24] and [28]-[30] that a previously satisfied maintenance order did not prevent a party from re-applying for mainte- nance.

If respondents consider an applicant unlikely to meet the threshold test for maintenance, they should have the matter determined at the interim hearing instead of settling on the basis of “characterisation” at the final hearing. Another tip An applicant will often think twice about applying for interim maintenance (legal costs usually being an issue) if the other party makes an offer of X dollars per week for a limited period say, 3–6 months (depending on the circumstances) on notice that it is expected that the applicant will endeavour to obtain work during that period and produce evidence of having done so. An applicant may threaten proceedings when those payments stop, but will often not proceed with an interim maintenance application in the face of a respondent who builds a defence like this. Miscellaneous As to interim hearings, Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management requires parties to: • File and serve all expert reports that are relevant to the issues to be determined no later than 7 days before the hearing (para 5.17); Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

The Initiating Application should apply for both interim orders (current need) and final orders (future need) for maintenance. Property orders are usually only sought as final orders unless an interim order, e.g. an injunction against disposing of assets or an order for payment of litigation costs, is called for. An interim order can be sought after an Initiating Application has been filed by filing an Application in a Proceeding (in WA, an Application in a Case) (“forms”) and an affidavit explaining why the interim order is sought. Before seeking an interim order, a party must make a genuine attempt to settle the matter: FLR 4.03 (in WA, FCR 79) Unless urgent due to alleged high risk, a party may only file up to 2 Applications in a Proceeding without leave: para 5.22 of the Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management. Counsel Seek a recommendation of a barrister for your family law work, and use him/her readily. Brief counsel to appear at the interim and final hearings, if you are not appearing yourself; seek his/her advice; email your papers to counsel for settling before you file it. Trial directions and final hearing For any final hearing, the Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management contains standard trial directions that include an exchange of any amended application/response together with a consoli- dated trial affidavit and financial statement; the filing of a Case Outline document for final hearing no later than 2 days prior to the trial date; and a list of authorities to be relied on.",

Respondents must file and serve a Response to an Application in a Proceeding and an affidavit in support. Amended applications Any significantly different orders may be sought by re-filing and serving the application as an “Amended Initiating Application” showing the new orders sought underlined in red, and “amended” appearing wherever “initiating application” is mentioned. No filing fee is payable. An affidavit setting out the facts relied on for the new orders sought can be contained in an affidavit filed before the final hearing.

      "text": "SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 6 – 35 AFFIDAVITS An affidavit is the sworn evidence of the person making it, filed in support of a party’s case. An affidavit should use the witness’s everyday language, not yours. Build it in logical sequence, using separate paragraphs for each essential fact, covering all relevant issues. For credibility, check all figures with care. It must be admissible as to what the witness can say about her/his own situation (no “I believe…” or “I submit…”). An affidavit should state facts, not feelings. Get to the point (the need for maintenance) quickly and limit your pages to a comfortable read. The trick is to say much in a short space, and say it clearly. A well-formed affidavit can make all the difference. AFFIDAVIT OF APPLICANT FOR SPOUSAL OR DE FACTO MAINTENANCE (AND PROPERTY ORDERS) Introduction 1. I am the Applicant. 2.

They may be issued if either party is either present or ordinarily resident in Australia or an Australian citizen when the application is filed: ss 39(4) and 39A(2) FLA. For WA, see s 205X FCA. A de facto claim requires a 2-year relationship or a child or substantial contributions in relation to a de facto relationship (and serious injustice if the order sought is not made) or a registered relationship (s 90SB) AND that either party was ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the application was made, and that (unless both were ordinarily resident there for a third of the relationship or substan- tial contributions had been made there) both parties were ordinarily resident there when the relationship broke down (s 90SK). For WA (yet to opt in to the FLA regime) see s 205Z FCA. A de facto partner may not apply under the FLA if their relationship broke down before 1 March 2009 (1 July 2010 in SA) unless both parties opt-in under the Amendment Act (No. 115 of 2008). Note – In de facto claims, a party’s spouse or other de facto may become a party: s 90SM(10) FLA Your venue for property proceedings is the FCFCA or, in WA, the FCWA.

The Court cited Henry v Henry [1996] HCA 51, adjourning proceedings in the Family Court of Australia pending a decision by the District Court of NZ (where proceedings were issued after the Australian case had begun). But see Ashforth [2010] FamCA 37 at [23]-[40]. The High Court applied its decision in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 in which the Court held that a party who has properly issued proceedings in Australia has a prima facie right to have the proceedings determined by an Australian court unless Australia is the clearly inappropriate jurisdiction (the doctrine of forum non conveniens). TIME LIMIT The deadline for a property (or spousal maintenance) application is 12 months after a divorce order has taken effect (s 44(3)) or 2 years after the end of a de facto relationship (s 44(5)) or 12 months after a BFA is set aside (s 44(3B) or (5)), except by leave or consent. As to “consent”, see s 44(3AA) or (5A). This time limit does not apply to applications to set aside a property order under s 79A or s 90SN or to vary, revive, suspend or discharge a maintenance order under s 83 or s 90SI.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 4 LAWYERS’ OBLIGATIONS The merger of courts in 2021 brought with it a shift in how family law cases proceed, with a greater emphasis on dispute resolution before and during a proceeding, and new rules to facilitate that shift. Lawyers must assist their clients to comply with their duty at all times to act consistently with the main purpose of the rules of court, being the just and timely resolution of disputes at a reasonable cost to the parties: FLR 1.04 (in WA, FCR 5-8). Also see ss 95 and 96 FLA introduced in 2023. You must comply with the lawyers’ obligations set out in clause 6 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 FLR (financial proceedings) and clause 6 of Part 2 (parenting proceedings). In the FCWA see clause 6 of Division 1 of Schedule 1 FCR (financial cases) and clause 12 of Division 2 of that Schedule (parenting cases). Give your new clients the brochure Marriage, families and separation (s 12E FLA; s 65F FCA) and by their second appointment, the brochures Before you file – pre-action procedure for financial cases and, if applicable, Before you file – pre-action procedure for parenting cases. This judicial shift in emphasis is contained in the FCFCA’s Central Practice Direction – Family Law Case Management (CPD), which requires “the parties and their lawyers [to] think about the best way to con- duct their cases” in accordance with that shift (para 1.3). “The Court expects parties and their lawyers to have in mind, at all times, the cost of each step in the proceedings and whether it is necessary … [P]arties and lawyers are expected to approach proceedings in a manner directed towards identifying the issues in dispute and ascertaining the most … cost efficient method of resolution or determination.",

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 5 PARTIAL PROPERTY SETTLEMENTS It will often be useful for you to negotiate a partial property settlement with the other side. The leading case is Harris [1993] FamCA 49 in which the Full Court concluded at [43]: “( … ) Of necessity it is likely to be a somewhat imprecise exercise. Consequently, it must be exer- cised conservatively and the Judge must be satisfied that the remaining property will be adequate to meet the legitimate expectations of both parties at the final hearing, or that the order which is contemplated is capable of being reversed or adjusted if it is subsequently considered necessary to do so.” An advance of money to each party towards costs and expenses Unless your client has ready access to funds, negotiate an advance of funds to each party from bank accounts or realisable assets towards legal costs, valuation fees and other expenses. Characterise such advances as partial property settlements, so they stay notionally added to the asset pool (although ultimately debited to each party’s entitlement when property division is calculated). Propose that each party be advanced the same amount. If the other party is unrepresented, propose that they receive the same amount anyway (explaining that such amounts are brought into account at the end of the case). Document the advance and its terms by means of consent orders (for the wording of the order, see under “interim orders” in “precedents” below, and for the consent order procedure, see “consent orders” in chapter “other routine procedures”). A tip Do this early on, as a routine business-like arrangement for the equal benefit of both parties.

Your recourse if your proposal is rejected is the unpredictability and great expense of an application to the court for an order for interim costs (see chapter “other routine procedures”). Although an example of an interim costs order is given below, steer clear of such applications whenever possible. Even when they succeed, they only serve to reduce the parties’ divisible asset pool by the amount of their legal bills to obtain the order sought. An advance of capital (in a larger asset pool) to a party to assist in purchase of a new home before trial Negotiate as a partial property settlement – in cases of delay until the final hearing, and where there are ample other assets to satisfy the other party’s entitlement – an advance of money enabling a party (particularly with children) to buy another property in which to live. File consent orders to that effect, describing the advance as a partial property settlement. The advance will ultimately be deducted from that party’s eventual entitlement. For the wording of the order, see under “interim orders” in “precedents” below, and for the consent order procedure, see “consent orders” in chapter “other routine procedures”.

It is usually raised by a respondent who, by seeking an interim declaration under s 90RD FLA, disputes the applicant’s right to property orders. (In WA a respondent must seek an interim order dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction under s 205Z FCA. If the court does lack jurisdiction it may still award costs: FCR 11.1.) See “jurisdiction” above as to the right to bring a de facto property claim. A person is in a “de facto relationship” with another person if they are not married or related to each other and, having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a cou- ple living together on a genuine domestic basis: s 4AA(1) (in WA s 13A Interpretation Act 1984 (WA)). A “de facto relationship” includes same sex partners and can exist if a partner is married to someone else or is in another de facto relationship: s 4AA(5). Under s 4AA(2) those circumstances may include: • length of the relationship • ownership, use and acquisition of property • nature and extent of their common residence • degree of mutual commitment to a shared life • whether a sexual relationship exists • care and support of children • degree of financial dependence and support • reputation and public aspects of the relationship • whether the relationship is or was registered e.g under Relationships Act (Tas & Vic), Civil Partnerships Act (ACT & Qld) and Relationships Register Act (NSW and SA) A declaration may be sought under s 90RD (for WA see the 1st para above) that a de facto relationship of at least two years existed or did not exist between the",

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 9 Risk of disposal of property that may defeat or prejudice a property claim The Full Court in Waugh [2000] FamCA 1183 upheld a husband’s appeal against an injunction obtained by the wife, applying the Court’s ruling in Stowe [1980] FamCA 92 that the power to grant injunctions is limited to cases where there is a real danger that a property claim under s 79 may be defeated or prejudiced unless an injunction is granted. In Waugh, the Court at [52] said: “Had there been some clear evidence given by the wife (even if denied by the husband) of some disposition of property by the husband, or other conduct by him from which an inference might reasonably be drawn that he had embarked, or was about to embark, upon a course of action which was designed to or, irrespective of design, would be likely to defeat any anticipated order in the substantive proceedings in the wife’s favour, then perhaps we might be persuaded to uphold His Honour’s orders…However…there was no such clear evidence.” What evidence to file? The Court at [53]-[57] commented on the state of the evidence in that case as follows: “The wife’s affidavit in support of her application was replete with statements that she ‘feared’ the husband would do this or that with the property under his control, or with one or other of the trusts through which he conducts his business operations, but it contained no assertion that he had in fact disposed of anything or incurred any liability other than in the ordinary course of his business… Although (she) asserted that (he) had replaced himself as appointor of the various trusts, he had…done that…many months…prior to the parties’ separation.

In any event… His Honour’s orders…prevent any further alienation of the power of control of all the trusts until further order. Although the wife asserted that, since separation, the husband had removed her as a signatory of various trust and company bank accounts with the operation of which she had previously been involved, that is hardly a surprising thing for him to have done, in the circumstances, and is hardly a basis for inferring some intention on his part to dispose of or conceal assets. The wife’s material also disclosed that the husband had already paid to her…sums…pursuant to a partial property settlement agreement…and that he was paying her periodic maintenance… for herself and the children. The wife also asserted…that since separation she had been effectively excluded by the husband from the operation of the trusts and from access to its business records. Again, however, given the circumstances, including the partial settlement effected between the parties and the payment by the husband of not ungenerous maintenance for the wife, that is hardly surprising, and provides no basis for an inference of impropriety by the husband in relation to any property under his control.

However, in our view, that evidence is not sufficient to support such an inference…” The court went on (at [58]) to take account of the fact that in exchange for the wife’s removal of caveats, the husband was offering to give an undertaking to the court that he would not until further order cause a company on behalf of the trust to enter into any unconditional contract of sale of the property without giving to the wife’s solicitors 21 days notice in writing; nor, as director of the trustee company, vote in favour of any increase or cause there to be any increase in the secured borrowings beyond the present level.

Broker allowed to continue normal trading In H & H (Unrep) [2003] FamCA 1391 a broker was allowed to keep trading. The Court was unwilling to grant an injunction, pointing out that an injunction is not for the purpose of restricting the conduct of normal trading, and that no injunction should be granted unless there is some evidence of conduct likely to defeat an anticipated property order. Kay J, expressing the view of the Court, said at [17]-[19]: “Parties ought only be restrained from conducting their normal affairs pending the outcome of disputed proceedings if the failure to so restrain them is likely to seriously interfere with the proper adjudication of the claim and the meeting of the entitlements. …There was no suggestion here that the husband was doing something to subvert the wife’s position. It is just that she and her advisers took a position that if they were in charge of the assets they would trade in a different way.

It is now called a search order and is available under FLR 5.19 which entitles a party to apply for such an order: (a) requiring a respondent to permit the applicant, alone or with another person, to enter the respondent’s premises and inspect or seize documents or other property; (b) requiring the respondent to disclose specific information relevant to the case; and (c) restraining the respondent, for a period of no more than 7 days, from informing anyone else (other than the respondent’s lawyer) that the order has been made. A search order may be (and usually is) applied for without notice to the respondent: Rule 14.04(2). For the requirements of an application without notice, see “applying for interim or procedural order without notice” in chapter 8 as to FLR 5.11. Also: Rule 14.04(3) requires such an application to be supported by an affidavit that includes: (a) a description of the document or property to be seized or inspected; (b) the address of the premises where the order is to be carried out; (c) the reason the applicant believes the respondent may remove, destroy or alter the document or property unless the order is made; (d) a statement about the damage the applicant is likely to suffer if the order is not made; (e) a statement about the value of the property to be seized; (f) if permission is granted, the name of the person (if any) who the applicant wishes to accompany the applicant to the respondent’s premises.

The affidavit must be served on the respondent when the order is acted on: Rule 14.04(4). Lindenmeyer J explained search orders in Talbot [1994] FamCA 129 at [7] (also see [20]-[21]): “…[as being] to search for, inspect and remove for safekeeping (or take copies of) documents or things which are alleged by the [applicant] to be vital evidence in the action, where the [applicant] satisfies the court that there is a real risk that unless this is done the [respondent] will either destroy or hide the documents, so as to prevent their being placed before the court as soon as he or she gets wind of the [applicant’s] action…to ensure that [the court’s] proceedings are not rendered nugatory [futile] by the misbehaviour of a [respondent].” Also see Tassinari & Pesalaccio & Ors [2018] FamCA 12 at [85]-[94]. When and what to file? Apply for such an order where your client can prove their knowledge of the existence and location of a vital piece of evidence or valuable item of property and the respondent’s failure to disclose it or make it available for valuation. Apply without notice (ex parte) if respondent is likely to conceal the item if given notice of your application. Check with your barrister first.

See Full Court deci- sions such as Ferraro [1992] FamCA 64 from [159]; Hickey [2003] FamCA 395 at [39]; and AJO & GRO (Omacini) [2005] FamCA 195 at [46] as to the following steps: 1. Identify and value the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties as at the date of the hearing 2. Assess their financial, non-financial and welfare contributions under s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) as a percentage of the net value of their property (“total net assets” or “asset pool”) 3. Assess any relevant s 75(2) (or s 90SF(3)) factors, such as disparity of income and earning capacity and (the capital cost of) having the care of children, as an adjustment of the contri- bution based assessment (those factors being brought into account by s 79(4)(e)) (or s 90SM(3)) 4. Consider the effect of those findings and specify what order should in all the circumstances be made for a “just and equitable” outcome, as required by s 79(2) As to Step 1, the Full Court in Hickey referred to the necessity “to consider the whole of the property of the parties, however and whenever acquired” and the “obligation of each party to make a full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances” ([40]). As to Step 2, a “global approach” has been applied by the courts as the guideline in most cases, by assessing contributions in terms of a proportion of the total assets of the parties. This approach was approved in Norbis [1986] HCA 17 by the High Court, which added that an “asset by asset” approach is also available (see “asset by asset approach” under “contributions” below).

This approach was approved in Norbis [1986] HCA 17 by the High Court, which added that an “asset by asset” approach is also available (see “asset by asset approach” under “contributions” below). The “clean break” principle – Under s 81 (s 90ST for de facto claims) “the court shall, as far as practicable, make such orders as will finally determine the financial relationships between the par- ties to the marriage and avoid further proceedings between them”. See para (n) of “maintenance factors” in Chapter 6. Spousal maintenance – Property orders can eliminate the need for maintenance as well (thus a prop- erty claim is determined first: Clauson [1995] FamCA 10, but the court will in an appropriate case make an order for maintenance: DJM & JLM [1998] FamCA 97 at [17]. See also Mitchell [1995] FamCA 32 (where W needed maintenance after being awarded property settlement of 90%, but of a small asset pool of $300,000); and Bevan [1993] FamCA 95 at [53]. The four step approach continues to be applied by the courts since Stanford [2012] HCA 52 (HC). Stanford is summarised in Bevan [2014] FamCAFC 19 at [40]-[45]. In Bevan W “had arranged her life ‘as an independent woman’ in reliance on H’s representations over … 16 years[s] … that he would not make a claim against the property they owned in Australia” ([12]).

This decision was followed in SMB & MFB [2006] FamCA 46 where a trial judge characterised $102,500 W had received via interim orders as wholly partial property settlement. It was held that even if the trial judge was correct in finding the interim sums paid were not “spousal maintenance” but property, such sums will not necessarily be added back to the net asset pool. The court must examine whether expenditure was “beyond that which funded a reasonable standard of living and necessary outgoings”: SL & EHL [2005] FamCA 132. The Full Court in Chorn & Hopkins [2004] FamCA 633 at [42] cited earlier Full Court authority as follows: “There seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back monies that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred living expenses. Neither the FLA nor the case law require that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. Parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support.” In Gollings & Scott [2007] FamCA 397 at [68] the Full Court held that as a general rule, subject to obligations of maintenance and support and the considerations described in Kowaliw (below) as to waste, separated parties are entitled to get on with their lives independently of the other. This was applied by Rose J in Danford [2010] FamCA 420 (money spent on prostitutes not added back) and by Walters FM in Owens (No. 3) [2010] FMCAfam 3 (gift to new partner to buy a car not added back, but repayments of dubious “loans” were).",

In Miller [2009] FamCAFC 121, Strickland J held that a ruling that only part (instead of all) of H’s post-separation insurance proceeds should be added back as he was likely to have spent a portion of it on living expenses was in error without evidence from H as to how he had applied the funds. In Britton & Firmer [2011] FamCA 786 at [66] half of a $4m pool was added back, being the value of property transferred by H into his parents’ superannuation fund. Also see Talbot [2015] FamCAFC 132 at [48]-[53]. In Shimizu & Tanner [2011] FamCA 271 Bryant CJ did not add back spent post-separation income.

Another option is to apply for an undefended hearing: Melville & Dent [2008] FamCA 926. The Full Court also held in Bonnici [1991] FamCA 86 at [52] that due to non-disclosure by a husband his tax liabilities should not be brought into account. Furniture and other chattels The Full Court said in J & J [2006] FamCA 951 at [60] that “[i]t is not uncommon in many defended property settlement cases for one or both parties to provide estimates of the value of items such as furniture and other household items, motor vehicles, or tools of trade, and if such estimates are not chal- lenged, they are taken into account in determining the value of the property to be divided between the parties”. The Court also approved the trial judge’s acceptance of the wife’s estimate (unchallenged by the husband until his appeal) for tools of trade “ascertained after talking with persons with knowledge of what could be achieved for the tools on the second hand market” ([56]). In furniture disputes the court often orders that one party prepare two lists of equal value of all the furniture, the other party to choose one list: see a discussion of possible orders in Hamill [2007] FamCA 1736 at [127]-[131].

The latest member statement or a Superannuation Information Form supplied by you to, and completed by, the fund trustee (see “procedure” below) will value the super.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 22 Is money from parents or other family a repayable loan or a financial contribution made on behalf of its recipient? Examples of the court’s approach – • In Af Petersens [1981] FamCA 50 at [31] and [60] Nygh J allowed a discounted princi- pal sum as a liability (but no interest) where H’s father failed to enforce repayment of his secured loan or interest for 5 years. That case was applied by the Full Court in Winston (No. 2) [2013] FamCAFC 147 at [22], [48]-[52]. In H & H (Unrep) [2001] FamCA 134 the Full Court treated a mother’s advance of “her money” ([20]) as a loan despite uncertainty as to its terms. • Watts J in T & T (Pension Splitting) [2006] Fam CA 207 at [75]-[83] accepted the evidence of a loan being repayable by H to his brother in light of their involvement together in a family con- cern – documentation including a loan account; interest payments; and evidence given by the creditor himself that the debt, which had been at call, was now being called in. Watts J applied Biltoft [1995] FamCA 45 in which the Full Court at [52]-[53] discussed the courts’ usual ap- proach to assessing secured and unsecured liabilities. • By contrast, Bryant CJ in C & B [2005] FamCA 94 at [75]-[8] held that money advanced by H’s mother was a s 79(4) contribution on his behalf not a loan as it did not have the usual indicators of a loan, such as interest being payable, repayments being required, and a time being set for capital repayment. In Maddock & Anor (No. 2) [2011] FMCAfam 1340 at [46], [63]-[68] and [72]-[73] those factors were considered and it was held that $240K paid by H’s father towards H",

Examples – a party’s earnings; or money or other assets brought into the marriage by a party or their parents; or a party’s payment of deposit, loan repayments or other outgoings, or expenses to acquire, maintain or improve real estate, business, cars or other property. b) Non-financial contributions “made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party … or a child … to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties … or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that … property, whether or not that … property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties … or either of them”.

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 27 Rule of thumb – “equality or thereabouts” in most cases In the Full Court case of Waters & Jurek [1995] FamCA 101 Fogarty J (with whom Hase J agreed) said (at [29] of his Honour’s reasons): “In the majority of property cases little difficulty is encountered in the contribution step and increasingly in the general run of cases the conclusion is likely to be one of equality or thereabouts.” His Honour continued: “There is no doubt that the centre of gravity in the determination of property cases has, especially in more recent times, moved to the evaluation of the s 75(2) factors, and the significance of that has been heightened because of recent Full Court decisions which have emphasised those provisions and indicated that they should be given real rather than token weight.” This highlights the two-stage process of assessing a party’s property entitlement: • Firstly, assess contributions (as a proportion of the total net assets); and then • (again, as a proportion of the total net assets) evaluate s 75(2) (or s 90SF(3)) factors. “Token weight” being given to those factors refers to the court’s practice in its early years of awarding the financially weaker party (usually then the wife) an extra 10–20% without any particular reference to its monetary value in compensation for those factors. However, just as s 75(2) factors are said to have been given real weight since the 90s, financial contributions have also been given closer attention since the late 90s by it being taken less for granted that contributions should be assessed as approximately equal where a significant financial contribution has been made by one of the parties. See, in particular, Pierce (above). Prior to then, the Full Court in Bremner [1994] FamCA 116 found itself weighing up competing judgments",

See, in particular, Pierce (above). Prior to then, the Full Court in Bremner [1994] FamCA 116 found itself weighing up competing judgments of its Court in Money [1994] FamCA 54 as to whether the significance of an initial contribution by a party (assets brought into the marriage) could only be offset by contributions of the other party that exceeded that initial contribution, or may be eroded by the other’s contributions even though they might not “outstrip” that initial contribution. The Court chose the latter approach in Money of Fogarty J (with whom Holden J agreed), his Honour adding at para 10 of his reasons: “The longer the marriage the more likely it is that there will be later factors of significance and in the ultimate the exercise is to weigh the original contribution with all other, later, factors and those later factors, whether equal or not, may in the circumstances of the individual case reduce the significance of the original contribution.” In particular, the role of homemaker and parent “should be recognised not in a token way but in a substantial way”: Mallet [1984] HCA 21 and Ferraro [1992] FamCA 64.

Unequal contributions These are found where an initial contribution (of money or other property) is brought into the marriage by a party, or a significant asset contributed to the asset pool by one party during the marriage (such as money from parents or an inheritance). These become more significant: • The shorter the marriage (10 years qualified in Pierce below) • The closer the contribution is to the end of the marriage • The greater the contribution relative to the asset pool (Pierce’s was $200K out of $300K) Initial contributions (assets brought into the marriage by one party) In Pierce [1998] FamCA 74, where H had contributed about $200,000 at the beginning of the parties’ 10-year marriage representing about two-thirds of their total net assets, the Full Court overruled the trial judge’s assessment of 55% for his contributions (including his post-separation",

It is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. In considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution…regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. In the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home.” The Full Court said in Jabour [2019] FamCAFC 78 at [55]: “ … [T]he import of Pierce is that the weight to be attached to an initial contribution must be assessed against the rubric of all of the contributions, both financial and non-financial, made by the parties over the course of their relationship.” Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 30 Guide to assessing contributions What follows is a rough guide to assessing your client’s contributions entitlement, which is your next calculation once the net asset pool has been identified and valued. This guide is simply based on the court’s own assessment of contributions in a variety of cases (both initial contributions and contributions during the relationship e.g. assets gifted by family members, as to which see Kern [2014] FCCA 1108). See table below. Keeping and updating a record like this will give you a feel for how the court ap- proaches the assessment of contributions, and keep you in touch with any shift in the court’s approach. The easier part of the exercise is to assess whether your client’s case is within that “majority of property cases” (Waters & Jurek [1995] FamCA 101 at [29]) where “equality or thereabouts” is the contributions assessment. Assessing how a court will rule in a case of obvious inequality, in the context of which is a discretionary exercise, is not as easy but can be made easier by comparing assessments in decided cases. Finding comparable contributions assessments should enable you to make a contributions assessment in your case (to which you then add your adjustment for s 75(2), or s 90SF(3), factors) and give you some forensic basis for arguing the question of your client’s entitlement with the other party or their lawyer. The Full Court said in Hoffman [2014] FamCAFC 92 at [59]: “The facts of each case are, of course, unique to it and the discretion wide. But, that does not mean that like cases ought not provide a path to consistency in the exercise of the discretion.” Definitions “Case” – see Case Table for the case citation “Years” – years of marriage including pre-marital cohabitation “Contribution/asset",

(Where both parties have made initial or later financial contributions, “contribution” is the excess of the higher over the lower contribution.) Do not count any contribution that was not used for the benefit of the family. The onus of proof is on the party alleging that a contribution was not spent for the family’s benefit.

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 35 Asset by asset approach to contributions While a “global approach” is adopted in most cases (where the court assesses contributions by both parties as a whole on an overall view), an “asset by asset” approach (which would be difficult to apply in most cases) may be taken in some cases (Norbis [1986] HCA 17 per Mason and Deane JJ at [16]). An “asset by asset” approach might be taken in the case of: • Superannuation where significant contributions were made by the member spouse pre-relationship or post-separation, or both (see “examples of separate pools approach” under “treatment of superannuation” below) • Super in the form of a pension payable to a member spouse for a disability arising from a work-related injury post-separation: T & T (Pension Splitting) [2006] FamCA 207 • A pension that cannot be converted into a lump sum (i.e. by being commuted): McKinnon [2005] FamCA 1245 • An inheritance received by a party late in the marriage, where the existence of other assets allow for a just result: Bonnici [1991] FamCA 86 at [41]-[44]. In Muir & Royston [2010] FamCA 374 at [81], [98], [147], [156], [159] and [184] a three pools approach was adopted to separately assess contri- butions as to inheritances received by each party cf. Singerson & Joans [2014] FamCAFC 238 where a global approach was taken despite H’s post-separation inheritance due to W’s greater marital contributions (also see Stone [2015] FamCAFC 18) • A short marriage, where the parties kept their assets separate: McMahon [1995] FamCA 145. In Edgar & Faines [2009] FamCAFC 22, Warnick J upheld Spelleken FM’s approach to reinstate the parties to a 3-year marriage with their respective pre-marital properties, with an adjustment to allow for money paid by the husband towards the wife’s house, holidays",

See also Scofield & Shaw [2011] FMCAfam 1296 at [24]. But in Kiefer [2009] FMCAfam 279 at [46] and [51] O’Sullivan FM preferred a global approach despite the parties’ short marriage (less than 2 years) as their assets had not been kept entirely separate • A long marriage where the parties’ finances were kept separate: Stiller & Power [2011] FMCAfam 996 • A long separation (prior to the final hearing) during which the parties informally managed different assets: Zalewski [2005] FamCA 996 at [166].

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 36 ASSESS SECTION 75(2) (OR, FOR DE FACTO CLAIMS, SECTION 90SF(3)) FACTORS Third step of your entitlement calculations Just as the court will undertake if your case does not settle, this is your next stage of calculations once the net asset pool has been identified and contributions assessed – to consider adjusting your contributions percentage by a percentage for s 75(2) factors. Applications for property settlement and spousal maintenance are heard together but the court will rule on the entitlement to a property order first, because after the property settlement there may be no need for maintenance as well: Anast & Anastopoulos [1981] FamCA 96. The Full Court held in that case that a distinction had to be drawn between a “maintenance component’’ and an order for lump sum maintenance because a “maintenance component’’ is part of a s 79 order and as such is final, and not capable of variation under s 83 as a spousal maintenance order is. See “relationship between spousal maintenance and property orders” in Chapter 6. Court’s approach to s 75(2) as part of a property settlement For the financially weaker party (traditionally, the wife) the court will add a percentage of the asset pool to the contributions assessment for any relevant s 75(2) factor. Alternatively, a specified amount may be awarded (e.g. Guthrie & Rushton [2009] FamCA 1144; Sinclair [2012] FamCA 388 at [103]; and Hayton & Bendle [2010] FamCA 592 at [198]). In the High Court case of Mallet [1984] HCA 21 at [18] of his judgment Wilson J said: “The objective of the section is not to equalise the financial strengths of the parties.

It is to em- power the court, following a dissolution of a marriage, to effect a redistribution of the property of the parties if it be just and equitable to do so.” The Full Court in Clauson [1995] FamCA 10 said: “It has long been recognised that in most cases the most valuable ‘asset’ which a party can take out of the marriage is a substantial, reliable, income-earning capacity: see Best [1993] FamCA 107. There is, we think, at times a tendency to assess s 75(2) factors in percentage terms without considering its real impact, and we think there is legitimacy in the views expressed in more recent times that the Court has tended to operate in this area within artificially delineated boundaries. That is, it appears almost to be inevitable that the s 75(2) factors will be assessed in a range between 10% and 20%. A number of cases will justify an assessment outside those parameters and in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. ( … ) If one were to conclude that the contributions should have been no less than 25% ($350,000) then in our view the s 75(2) factors should be in the range of a further $350,000 or approximately 25%. Such a view would result in an overall conclusion that the property should be divided equally so that they each receive about $700,000. Equality is not … the justification for that conclusion.

Fogarty J ([35] of his reasons) discussed why that disparity of income should attract a property adjustment when the wife would not have been able to establish a need for spousal maintenance: “The responsibility of the Court, when hearing a s 79 application, is to make an order which recognises, as far as possible, the fact that the order is made on an arbitrarily determined day, but is to have a prospective effect on the parties’ lives.” Fogarty J, expressing a majority view of the Full Court, reviewed the earlier tendency of the court to regard s 75(2) as “needs factors”, a view later rejected by the Full Court (most strongly in Collins [1990] FamCA 141), saying at [36] of his judgment: “Both the Full Court and the High Court reiterated the view that the test [for any s 75(2) factor] is its relevance to a ‘just and equitable’ order.” The Full Court in Waters & Jurek (above) at [32]-[33] referred to: • disparity of income and earning capacity as a “commonly relevant” factor under s 75(2)(b), and • the care of the children as “traditionally calling for significant attention” under s 75(2)(c).

Indeed, Collins [referred to above] is a strong example of that. The s 75(2) adjustment, largely centred around s 75(2)(c), was of the dimen- sion of $1m. Given the custodian mother’s independent wealth, it could not and was not sought to be justified on financial or economic factors alone or even significantly. (…) Disparity in income and income earning capacities is a common basis for making an adjustment un- der s 79 quite independently of its maintenance implications. The rationale for that usually lies in the circumstance that the difference in income earning capacities is significant and/or has arisen either directly or indirectly as a consequence of the marriage and the roles which the parties played during the marriage. In most marriages, there is a division of roles, duties and responsibilities between the parties. As part of their union, the parties choose to live in a way which will advance their interests – as individuals and as a partnership. The parties make different contributions to the marriage, which the law recognises cannot simply be assessed in monetary terms or to the extent that they have financial consequences.

Often, opportunities to do so are no longer open; or, if they are, time is required before they can be accessed and acted upon. When the marriage ends, especially where that marriage has been a long one, one cannot separate the parties as individuals from the people they became in the context of the marriage relationship, and the allocation of roles, duties and responsibilities which it entailed. In some cases, an adjustment is called for because it would be unjust for the roles and activities of a party, which were recognised until separation, and which largely determined or influenced the personal development of that party and the arrangements between the parties, to suddenly count for little, while those of the other party, which were of equal significance during the marriage, to now have a far greater financial impact outside the home (...) An order under s 79 would be unjust and inequitable in its operation if it failed to address the manner in which the value of the parties’ roles, adopted in the course of, and for the purposes of, the marriage, can be altered by the fact of separation. Those roles can be instantaneously converted into liabilities. The equality of the parties’ positions is terminated.

Large superannuation in the hands of one party is no longer the s 75(2) factor it was before the introduction of Part VIIIB because such disparity is now rectified by the making of a splitting order. Care of children, including capital cost of children not covered by periodic child support The Full Court in Collins [1990] FamCA 141 said: “The child support order would have gone a considerable distance towards meeting the living expenses of the child, but would not have covered the capital costs involved in the provision of a home and the like which necessarily flows from the wife being the sole custodian of this young child. (And for use if your client’s spouse is a neglectful parent) Additionally in this case is the circumstance that the husband had had nothing to do with the child, either financially or socially, from the separation to the trial, and that appeared to be his attitude for the future. Consequently, the trial Judge was entitled to proceed as he did upon the basis that the whole of that responsibility would rest on the shoulders of the mother. It appears to us that the trial Judge was entitled to place quite significant weight upon this circumstance in this case.” Guest J cited that statement in Farmer & Bramley [2000] FamCA 1615 at [225].

The Full Court properly stated the position in Brandt [[1997] FamCA 21]: ‘If, when evaluating factors under s 75(2), it is appropriate to give consideration to such non-economic matters, then presumably it is important to weigh into the process the pleasure, company and sense of purpose that children bring both now and in the future. The difficulty in evaluating such matters demonstrates why approaching the matter in the manner his Honour did is not an appropriate course to be adopted. It is proper to take into account the economic ramifications of having responsibility for the children and the quasi- economic contributions involved in raising children which include washing, ironing, cook- ing, transporting and the like.

( … ) In my view, the proper matters for evaluation include those set out in Brandt (above), namely: • the economic ramifications of having the responsibility for the children; • the quasi-economic contributions involved in raising children which include washing, ironing, cooking, transporting and the like; and • the issue of income opportunities foregone by reason of responsibilities to children. This is not to be taken as being an exhaustive list, but an indication of relevant matters for consid- eration.” Reasonable standard of living In Collins [1990] FamCA 141 the Full Court at also reviewed the trial judge’s ruling as to paragraph (g) (“a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable”): “His Honour referred to this aspect in the following terms: ‘Since separation (the standard of living) of the wife has sharply diminished but the husband has continued in the former lifestyle as witnessed by the residence in Hunters Hill, the acquisition of luxury cars and vessels, etc.’ The parties enjoyed a high standard of living during the course of their marriage. At trial the husband was a wealthy man living in a very substantial style. The wife was the custodian of their young child and it was legitimate for his Honour, in the quest to achieve a standard of living which was ‘reasonable’, to have regard to those circumstances.” Cronin J said in Carmel-Fevia & Fevia (No. 3) [2012] FamCA 631 at [182]: “[Under s 75(2)(g) I propose to] make an adjustment so that there is a fair outcome which enables the wife to re-establish her financial security in the future with some confidence.” OTHER SECTION",

It appears for consideration just before para- graph (e) which deals with the s 75(2) (or s 90SF(3)) factors. The Full Court explained the paragraph (d) factor in Lee Steere [1985] FamCA 57 as follows: “Section 79(4)(d) directs the Court to consider the effect of any proposed order on the earning capacity of either party to the marriage. This is clearly a relevant consideration where the only or major asset available for division between the parties is the asset from which one of the parties derives his or her livelihood, whether it be a business, a professional practice or a farm. But it is not an absolute factor: it is one of several factors to be considered in arriving at an order which in all the circumstances is just and equitable: s 79(2). An order which would deprive a party substantially of what he or she is entitled to by reason of contribution would not normally be considered just and equitable.” The Court said: “In our view, the correct principle was laid down by Asche J in Magas [1980] FamCA 67 at [13]: ‘If arrangements can be made which would relieve the spouse who is working a farm as a farmer, from selling the farm but at the same time doing proper justice to the claim of the spouse who is not living on the farm, then of course those arrangements should be made.’ However, his Honour then went on to say: ‘If there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place.

It becomes an incident of the sad fact that, when two persons separate, property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. That is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled.’” The Court then added: “Paragraph (d) is, in our view, mainly relevant to the question of the ways and means in which the entitlement of a party can be met. It may be that in certain cases the destruction of the business can be avoided by allowing the payment of the order in instalments: Smyth [1977] FamCA 74 (FC) or to postpone it for a period as was done in Magas (above) provided this can be done without injustice to the applicant. Payment cannot be postponed for too long, unless the amount earns interest in the meanwhile or is expressed as a percentage on sale: Waters [1981] FamCA 19, and adequate arrangements are made for the support of the applicant and any child dependants in the meanwhile. Where the business has an adequate cash flow, it may be preferable to provide for continued maintenance of the wife, despite the provisions of s 81. But if, as Asche J pointed out in Magas, injustice can only be avoided by the sale and division of the business property… this must be done.” Note – The only other s 79(4) (or s 90SM(4)) matters to be taken into account are paragraphs (f) (“any other order made…affecting a party…or",

Part VIIIB: • enables a valuation of the true worth of a superannuation interest, and • empowers the court to make a splitting order requiring payments under a superannuation policy to be allocated between the member and the non-member spouse Property orders may include superannuation interests of spouses or de facto partners: s 90XS. Note – For de facto couples in WA, see the schedule of equivalent legislative sections at p 7-56A. Splitting orders Section 90XT(1) specifies the following types of splitting order: A court, in accordance with s 90XS, may make the following orders in relation to a superannuation interest (other than an unsplittable interest): (a) if the interest is not a percentage-only interest – an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest: (i) the non-member spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the regulations (FL(Super)Regs); and (ii) there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order; Note – Before making such an order, the court must allocate a base amount to the non-member spouse not exceeding the value determined under s 90XT(2) below: s 90XT(4).

A “type (c) order” is rare, as explained above. See “superannuation orders, by courtesy of Stephen Bourke” under “precedents” below, and Stephen’s accompanying explanatory notes.

Flagging orders A court, under s 90XU(1), may make a s 79 property order in relation to a superannuation interest (other than an unflaggable interest): (a) directing the trustee not to make any splittable payment in respect of the interest without leave of the court; and (b) requiring the trustee to notify the court, within a period specified in the order, of the next occasion when a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest.

If superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: (a) value the superannuation interest (according to the Regulations if an order under Part VIIIB is sought or according to the Regulations or otherwise if no order is sought); (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances; (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e) (which refers to the s 75(2) factors), (f) and (g); and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under Part VIIIB in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 46 Global approach or asset by asset? The Full Court in Coghlan (above) at [62] said this: “The parties’ contributions to all items…(including the superannuation interest) would then be as- sessed on either a global or an asset by asset basis. It might then be necessary in the s 75(2) con- text to have regard to the parties’ future superannuation entitlements (having regard of course to any division proposed on the basis of their contributions), with consideration then being given to the overall justice and equity of any proposed award or order (including any proposed splitting order).” The Full Court in Coghlan held that super may be included in the one pool where the parties agree to do so or where it is of small value relative to the other assets or where features of the interest are such that it is appropriate to do so, but that otherwise a separate list should be prepared for other superannuation interests. The cases below, however, indicate a wider use being made by the courts since Coghlan of the one pool approach. In C & B, Bryant CJ did so in relation to super worth $320,000, representing 25% of the value of the non-super assets. And in L & L (Levick), Moore J did so for super of $421,000, equating to 33% of the non-super. In fact, it seems that the amount or relative value of the super are less relevant to the courts’ approach than its origin. In P and P, below, Brown FM separately considered super where 40% of it had accrued before and after the relationship. In T & T (Pension Splitting), below, both pool approaches were taken, enabling a small super to be in- cluded with non-super, Watts J dealing with the other super separately",

Watts J said at [14]: “…the parties agreed that the wife’s Colonial First State superannuation entitlement would be treated as property; and given the amount of (her) superannuation in the context of this case, that would have been an appropriate course in any event.” Note – T & T (Pension Splitting) (above) also features below under the separate pools approach because the husband, a police officer who sustained a disabling injury after separation, had two superannuation policies with a total value of $1.8m which were considered separately (one of the interests being in the growth phase and the other in the payment phase). 2. Super accrued during marriage included in asset pool C & B [2005] FamCA 94 was a 24 year marriage with two children, where H was a doctor on $177,000 a year and W a dietitian earning $60,000. Their non-super assets totalled $1.29m, and super (in the growth phase) about $320,000 (H’s three policies worth $250,000 and W’s super $70,000 from her own policy and her account in their self-managed fund). Bryant CJ found that during the marriage the parties’ contributions were equal, but that post- separation an adjustment of 7% was required in H’s favour in light of $130,000 contributed by H’s father and H’s mortgage payments post-separation.

I come to that conclusion for the following reasons: a) That although the husband will have more superannuation than the wife and less existing assets, the difference in the result achieved by such an order and what the husband was seeking is close to $90,000 and in my view is not something which will prejudice the husband in any demonstrated way; b) The husband’s financial position is fairly secure and whilst the extra cash which might have been payable by the wife would be of value to him there is no evidence that it is crucial to his finances; c) The husband’s earning capacity is significantly greater than the wife’s and if she wants to retain the former matrimonial home then it would be more difficult for her to repay higher borrowings to meet the greater obligation to the husband.” Note – The mix of tangible assets and super (for a just and equitable outcome) was that instead of more cash to H, and a super",

Parties’ self-managed super assessed in same pool as non-super Here is another “one pool” case where a wife was given a lesser super split in exchange for more cash (for re-housing needs and the capital cost of children). L & L (Levick) [2003] FamCA 40 was a 22-year marriage with two children. The husband was a banker and the wife was studying as a naturopath. They had non-super assets of $1.28m net and super in the growth phase, in their self-managed fund, of $421,000. Moore J considered (at [39]) that it was “appropriate to the case” for the super to be included in the one asset pool and a global approach taken to assessing contributions. Contributions These were considered to just favour H at 51:49 as financial contributions from him and his father ($100,000+) slightly outweighed W’s non-financial contributions. Moore J ([46]) then said: “I apply this assessment also to the superannuation that was built up entirely in the time since their relationship began.” Section 75(2) factors These were then considered at [51]–[54].

Noting at [54]–[7] that W, who had net assets of $52K (car, shares etc), would need another $703K in cash (from the sale of their home), Moore J at [60]–[70] considered the mix of non- super v super assets, concluding: “At the core of this is (the wife’s) need to rehouse after the…home is sold and to enable her to provide adequately for herself from investment funds. (After reviewing her likely expenses)… on that scenario things could end up being a bit tight, leaving her with little left over as a buffer for contingencies and independent living.” The court went on to consider the position of H (for whom the outcome should also be just and equitable) and decided to reduce W’s super split entitlement by 60% for more cash. The value of that 60% ($124K) was discounted for immediate payment and tax to $83K. Spousal maintenance Spousal maintenance at $550 per week was granted to the wife until receipt of her share of the proceeds of sale of the house, when she would have a fund to invest for an income stream until she was able to re-enter the paid workforce. 4.

Large super to which 40% of H’s contributions were extra-marital P & P [2005] FMCAfam 576 at [83]–[114] is an example of the former FMC’s approach to prop- erty settlement as to both non-super assets and large super. This was a 12-year marriage with no children. H, 41, was a member of the Defence Forces. W retired early from the Defence Forces and for some years had been in other employment. Their assets were non-super ($232,000); H’s super (three policies totalling $513,000); and W’s super (two policies totalling $41,000). H’s super included a DFRDB interest worth $458,000 acquired after 20 years of service, so that six years had accrued before the relationship and two years after separation. H also had long service leave and recreation leave due (worth $24,000, which was treated as a financial resource of his). Brown FM assessed the parties’ contributions to non-super and to the four small super policies (the parties having two each) as equal, referring to the marriage as having been a “genuine part- nership” as had been stated in Figgins [2002] FamCA 688 where each party had worked hard in their respective marital roles ([91]–[92]). Brown FM then examined the nature of the DFRDB interest, W’s contributions and the effect of a super split. It was found ([96]) to be significant that of his 20 year membership of the fund, H’s contributions financially and through his defence service when not cohabiting with W equated to 40% of the whole, so that 8 years of contributions were his alone. However, it was held to be wrong to approach the matter arithmetically alone ([98]) and unfair to “sheet home” to W her decision to retire prematurely from the Service, which she had done in",

This amounted to an indirect contribution, as did the “travails of the husband’s frequent postings”. Brown FM concluded ([111]) that the parties’ contributions to the DFRDB super should be regarded as favouring the husband in the ratio of 65/35%. Contributions equality for 60% of the super accrued during marriage Although the parties in P & P (above) had no children, it does not necessarily follow that the wife’s contributions to the DFRDB would have been greater than 35% had she also made homemaker and parent contributions, because in this case significant weight was given to the wife’s significant contributions by her own earnings, and indirectly through forgoing her career for her husband’s and undergoing postings with him. The key to the 65/35 assessment of contributions to the super was that 8 of the 20 years (40%) of the DFRDB’s growth came from contributions made (by his monetary contributions and by his service) either before or after the end of the parties’ relationship. So if the interest had accrued entirely or substantially within the marriage or cohabitation, the wife should have been able to expect a contributions assessment closer to equality, as occurred in L & L (Levick) (above) under “examples of one pool approach” above.

There were also no s 75(2) factors associated with children, such as the capital cost of children not covered by periodic child support; or a need to re-enter the workforce or retrain. 2. Post-separation super and real estate assessed separately Not a large super case, but in Ilett [2005] FamCA 432 the Full Court confirmed that the trial judge was entitled to exclude from the asset pool the post-separation superannuations of H and W (of $90,000 and $30,000 respectively) where the parties’ super had been negligible at sepa- ration and to take an asset by asset approach (but erred when doing so by not properly consid- ering W’s contributions to H’s super and to a post-separation house of his that was also left out of the pool or considering whether the overall result, which included the decimation of the main asset pool, was just and equitable). 3.

The policy gave him the right to ask the trustee to partially commute the pension into a lump sum at 55 (at age 60 he was able to commute the whole of his pension). Quick look at outcome of this unusual case The Category 2 super began 10 years before the marriage and continued for 3 years post- separation. H’s entitlement to the Category 1 super was triggered by his injury after separation. Contributions were assessed as 85/15 (Category 1) and 60/40 (Category 2) respectively in H’s favour.

The valuer therefore assessed the value not in accordance with the regulations but on the assumption that the pension is commuted by H at age 60. He did so by dividing the super into two as follows: • Valuation of super until age 60 (via Schedule 5’s method for valuing fixed term pensions) • Valuation from age 60, assuming that it is taken as a 50% pension and a 50% lump sum The resulting valuations are above. Watts J (para 110) then referred to the intent of the legislation: “In his second reading speech, the Hon. Daryl Williams, Attorney-General said: ‘Valuation is a particularly important issue for defined benefit schemes where there is a vested benefit and an unvested value. The unvested value is generally not accessible until the fund member satisfies certain requirements specified by the fund. The value of an interest in such a plan is typically based upon years of service with an employer and salary levels prior to retire- ment, as well as contributions and investment earnings. As the final benefit is dependent on future events, the full value of the retirement benefit cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of marriage breakdown. The value of an accumulation plan is generally more easily ascertained. For this reason, the bill will provide for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on the type of interest. The details of",

Considerations of fairness dictate that its full value should be recognised.” Contributions to the Category 1 (disability) super Noting (at paras 137–8) that the amount of the interest is mainly based on H being hurt on duty, the circumstances of the injury and his then salary ($127K), Watts J at paras 141–5 said: “The wife cannot claim any direct contribution following the husband being hurt on duty.

When moving to Goulburn the wife left her employment in Sydney and accepted a redundancy package. The increased responsibilities that the husband had as a result of his promotions placed additional burdens on the wife during the marriage and particularly at a time when the children were very young.” Watts J at [147]–[148] concluded that the wife could point to contributions that were relevant to the amount the husband was receiving by way of a superannuation interest in the payment phase, and assessed her contribution to Category 1 of the husband’s superannuation interest at 15%. Contributions to the Category 2 super Watts J at [149] referred to this statement from an early decision of the Full Court: “In Bailey [1978] FamCA 20 the Full Court said [at [30]]: ‘Contribution by one spouse to superannuation usually means the loss of moneys available for the current support of the family in order to provide security for both spouses on the retirement of the contributing spouse. Loss of the right to share in the superannuation by a divorced non-superannuated spouse is an important financial consequence of the dissolution of the marriage’.” How are super contributions made before and after cohabitation to be treated? The court put that question when it was noted that of H’s 23-year membership of the fund, only 10 years were during the marriage.

The importance of the imbalance of initial contribution will lessen as the period of cohabitation increases 2. Even though it is neither practical or desirable to approach cases in a pseudo mathematical way, a calculation of initial contribution does provide a “rough initial point of reference” (Clauson [1995] FamCA 10) 3. There need not be an imbalance of contribution during the cohabitation in favour of one party to offset the initial contribution of the other party. The importance of the initial contribution can be eroded over time in circumstances where there is equality of contribution during the course of the cohabitation (Bremner [1994] FamCA 116) 4. Finally regard needs to be had for what the Full Court said in Pierce [1998] FamCA 74 where the Full Court said that it was “not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances to the initial contribution.” Watts J then ([155]–[170]) reviewed the courts’ move away since the introduction of Part VIIIB from the “West and Green formula” (divide years in fund during cohabitation by years in fund overall; multiply result by net realisable value of immediate retirement benefit; divide result by 2), adding at [165]: “The Full Court in [Coghlan [2005] FamCA 429] suggested that something of West and Green might still survive, but said that contributions had to be looked at ‘in conjunction with all other contributions’.

The future financial circumstances of the parties were “revisited” ([75]-[7]) where the Court said: “If one addresses the size of the property pool and thinks in terms of 5 per cent lots, each represents just over $36,000. The major purpose of an adjustment in this case is to reflect the disparity in earning capacities, for a period reasonable in the circumstances. In our view, an appropriate adjustment in favour of the wife for s 75(2) factors is 22.5 per cent. This we consider likely to put the wife in the position of being able to obtain a modest home, but does not ignore the consequence to the husband in the nature of assets that he will retain.” 6. The outcome – that W receive 67.5% (45% + 22.5%) of the tangible assets, a split of H’s super interest of 20%, and retain her super ($6K); and H 32.5% of the tangible assets and 80% of his super – was impliedly confirmed as being just and equitable by the Court’s references to “a just and equitable mix” of tangible assets and superannuation throughout its judgment (at [26], [28], [31], [37], [39], [70], [73]-[4]).

The fourth step This is your final assessment stage once the asset pool has been identified, contributions and s 75(2) (or s 90SF(3)) factors assessed – to consider whether the result of those assessments would in all the circumstances be “just and equitable” as required by s 79(2) (s 90SM(3) in de facto claims). In Bonnaci [2012] FamCAFC 15 the Full Court said at [61]: “ … [The] Full Court has said on a number of occasions [that] the so-called fourth step is not an oppor- tunity to make a further adjustment; it is an opportunity for the [court] to determine finally how, in reality, a just and equitable order might be achieved based on the circumstances of the case before [it].” In Tomasetti [2000] FamCA 314 at [113]-[114], when reviewing an unjust “mathematical” outcome reached by adding percentages for a series of factors, the Full Court said: “In this context, the whole is not necessarily the sum of its component parts, and at the very least one has to stand back, at the end, and look at the final result, to ensure that the cumulative process has not produced a manifestly unjust result.” The court may adjust its assessment of steps 2 and 3 because of its likely impact on a party’s financial position (Full Court in Russell [1999] FamCA 1875 at [77]-[80]) and, where a split of super is available, may adjust the mix of assets each party is to receive.

See also L & L (Levick) [2003] FamCA 40 at [60]-[70] where the court allowed the wife to forgo 60% of her superan- nuation outcome in exchange for a discounted cash sum. Moore J, after considering the wife’s need to rehouse and to be able to provide adequately for herself from investment funds, said that “…on that scenario things could end up being a bit tight, leaving her with little left over as a buffer for contingen- cies and independent living”. Moore J, upon adding that “the outcome must be just and equitable overall, not just for her”, went on to consider the husband’s situation and find the adjusted orders to be just and equitable for both par- ties. Since the introduction of Part VIIIB (superannuation interests), s 79(2) is commonly referred to as addressing a proposed order’s “mix” of tangible assets and superannuation interests to be retained by each party: e.g. McCulough [2006] FamCA 840 where the Full Court at [26] asked “what would consti- tute a just and equitable ‘mix’ of asset types for each party”. An example of an adjustment of payment terms to meet the needs of both parties in a farming case is Casper [2009] FamCA 989 where Fowler J ordered the wife’s property settlement to be payable in part within 30 days to enable her to complete the purchase of another property, the balance being payable in 12 months with",

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 60 One asset pool or separate pools? Yours will usually be the one pool approach where a super interest is involved because all or most of super usually comes from contributions made during the relationship. Put your client’s super in a separate pool if it significantly accrued outside the relationship. In fact, why stop there? Consider also putting non-super assets such as pre-relationship or post-separation financial contributions into a separate pool, and argue for equal treatment. The examples of distribution below – as to who gets what and how – cover both the one pool and the separate pools approach. Summary of the four steps Step 1 is for you to draw up the table above, to identify and value the net asset pool (or pools). Step 2 is when you assess contributions, taking a global approach to them. Contributions will usually be equal, unless there has been a significant (usually financial) contribution by one party. Step 3 is your assessment of s 75(2) (in de facto claims, s 90SM(3)) factors. How to approach s 75(2) (or s 90SM(3)) A better guide for assessing s 75(2) factors than using case law (or getting confused about whether such factors should be a percentage of just non-super or the non-super and super combined) is to follow the judicially approved path of estimating the monetary value (the amount) of each client’s own s 75(2) factors instead of thinking of them in terms of a percentage of anything (Full Court in Clauson under “assess s 75(2) factors” above). The percentage – which is only a reference point – will come from what your monetary valuation of those factors represents as a proportion of the pool.

Step 4 is any proposed adjustment of your client’s entitlement for a just and equitable outcome. The mix of super and non-super It is at this stage that the courts will consider the mix of non-super and super to be divided between the parties. For example, a wife’s super entitlement as calculated may be reduced (and the husband’s increased) to allow the wife to receive more cash (and the husband less), enabling the wife to re-house herself and the children.

Note – As the courts refine their approach to superannuation, there is scope for your counsel to argue for consistent treatment to be given to pre-relationship contributions to non-super assets, which are often deemed to have been eroded over the course of a medium to long relationship. Assume for this example that Pool A contributions were assessed as equal (50/50) (as per Brown FM in P & P); and that as 40% of Pool B contributions by H were extra-marital, Pool B contributions (after an allowance for W’s indirect contributions to H’s career) were assessed as favouring H 65/35. The result of this contributions assessment is: H $900,000 (Pool A) x 50% $450,000 450,000 (Pool B) x 65% current value = $292,500 W $900,000 (Pool A) x 50% $450,000 450,000 (Pool B) x 35% current value = $157,500 Section 75(2) (or s 90SM(3)) If we stay with the P & P analogy, using just the size of the respective pools, disregarding the particular assets to be retained by each party and the assumption of W in a weaker financial position, W may be assessed as requiring no further adjustment for s 75(2) in our example, having regard to her equal earn- ing power, the absence of need arising from the care of children, and her capacity to boost her eventual Pool B interest through some serious investment.

A property settlement order containing but not specifying a maintenance component shall be taken not to be for the maintenance of a party: see subsection (2). Kay J in Doig [1999] FamCA 1363 at [23] referred to s 77A as being “designed to protect the revenue”, by requiring those receiving maintenance by way of a capital payment to be as accountable for Centrelink’s income-testing of pensions as those receiving maintenance income. The Court there dismissed the husband’s claim that the trial judge had erred by specifying a portion of the wife’s property settlement as a s 77A maintenance provision. Kay J on behalf of the Full Court held that although the specification may have been incorrect (the trial judge having held that the wife had no maintenance claim on top of her property settlement), it did not prejudice either party. Note – You would only use a s 77A clause in your order if you couldn’t avoid an order for lump sum maintenance (usually when one party is in receipt of a government pension, which makes contracting out of maintenance near impossible). As to the amount to specify in such a case, it needs to be a sum that would neutralise any future maintenance claim for as long as possible.

You would otherwise avoid such a clause because it enlivens s 83 by which the order can be varied in the future. In other words, you create the risk of future variation by dealing with spousal maintenance in your property order. For this reason, an agreement as to spousal maintenance is usually best documented in a financial agreement. It carries less risk of future variation and can act as a release of spousal maintenance (our precedent for which is at page 9–39). What to file? See “property order” in “precedents” below.

It is available at our online Members’ Archive (“useful papers”). Capital gains tax General principles for the proper approach to the effect of potential CGT payable upon the sale of an income-earning (“investment”) property were stated by the Full Court in Rosati [1998] FamCA 38 at [6.36] as follows: “(1) Whether the incidence of Capital Gains Tax should be taken into account in valuing a particular asset varies according to the circumstances of the case, including the method of valuation applied to the particular asset, the likelihood or otherwise of that asset being realised in the foreseeable future, the circumstances of its acquisition and the evidence of the parties as to their intentions in relation to that asset. (2) If the Court orders the sale of an asset, or is satisfied that a sale of it is inevitable, or would probably occur in the near future, or if the asset is one which was acquired solely as an investment and with a view to its ultimate sale for profit, then, generally, allowance should be made for any Capital Gains Tax payable upon such a sale in determining the value of that asset for the purpose of the proceedings. (3) If none of the circumstances referred to in (2) applies to a particular asset, but the Court is satisfied that there is a significant risk that the asset will have to be",

(3) If none of the circumstances referred to in (2) applies to a particular asset, but the Court is satisfied that there is a significant risk that the asset will have to be sold in the short to mid term, then the Court, whilst not making allowance for the Capital Gains Tax payable on such a sale in determining the value of the asset, may take that risk into account as a relevant s 75(2) factor, the weight to be attributed to that factor varying according to the degree of the risk and the length of the period within which the sale may occur. (4) There may be special circumstances in a particular case which, despite the absence of any certainty or even likelihood of a sale of an asset in the foreseeable future, make it appropriate to take the incidence of Capital Gains Tax into account in valuing that asset. In such a case, it may be appropriate to take the Capital Gains Tax into account at its full rate, or at some discounted rate, having regard to the degree of risk of a sale occurring and/or the length of time which is likely to elapse before that occurs.” In Blake [2007] FamCA 10, the Full Court said (at [24]) that the above were “no more than…guidelines for the exercise of the property settlement jurisdiction under s 79…and must be applied as the justice and equity of (each) case requires”.

Protect yourself and your client in those cases by making contact with the parties’ accountant – or, if necessary, a specialist forensic accountant – for some written advice. Income tax Division 7A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (known as “Division 7A”) treats (deems) amounts paid or lent or debts forgiven by a private company to a shareholder or shareholder’s associate as dividends: s 109B. These are “deemed dividends”. “Associate” includes a shareholder’s spouse: s 318 This treatment makes the amounts assessable income of the shareholder or associate (under s 44). Exceptions include debt repayment (s 109J); inter-company payments and loans (s 109K); and certain business loans (ss 109L–R). Note – Again, seek expert tax advice as to the tax implications of such transactions. The forensic accountants you employ to value or investigate the company and its business should be asked to include such advice in their report (and any other tax advice relevant to the post-settlement tax liability of each party). Goods and services tax GST is governed by A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (known as “the GST Act”).

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 71 LEAVE TO EXTEND TIME FOR ISSUING PROPERTY (OR MAINTENANCE) PROCEEDINGS The deadline for a property (or spousal maintenance) application is 12 months after a divorce order has taken effect (s 44(3)) or 2 years after the end of a de facto relationship (s 44(5)) or 12 months after a BFA is set aside (s 44(3B) or (5)), except by leave or consent. As to “consent”, see s 44(3AA) or (5A). This time limit does not apply to applications to set aside a property order under s 79A or s 90SN or to vary, revive, suspend or discharge a maintenance order under s 83 or s 90SI. Under s 44(4) (or s 44(6) for de facto claims), the court shall not grant leave unless it is satisfied: • that hardship would be caused to a party or a child if leave were not granted; or • in the case of maintenance, that at the time of the deadline for issuing proceedings the applicant’s circumstances were such that she/he would have been unable to support herself/himself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit: s 44(4) Note – An application for leave to proceed out of time under s 44(3) cannot be continued after the death of the respondent: see Slater [1985] FamCA 45. Hardship The Full Court held in Whitford [1979] FamCA 3 at [28] that if the Court is satisfied as to hardship, a “second question arises, that is whether in the exercise of its discretion the Court should grant or refuse leave to institute proceedings”.

The majority in Sharp said ([17]-[18]) that it “is well accepted that hardship … is more than the loss of a right to commence proceedings … the applicant must have a prima facie claim worth pursuing”.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 72 Delay The Full Court in Whitford (above) observed at [46]: “Until February 1978, the husband had continued to support the wife and the children at the standard at which the parties had lived for some years during cohabitation, and there was no good reason why proceedings should have been instituted any earlier.” Most of the leave cases deal with delays of between one and four years, although longer periods have been considered (10 years in Neocleous [1993] FamCA 42 and Vince (No.2) [2021] FCCA 282 at [207] and [307]; and 35 years in Catlin & Kent [1986] FamCA 53). In Edmunds [2018] FamCAFC 121 at [143]-[144] a 6 year delay was explained by W who had reasonably believed that she had an agree- ment with H which made it unnecessary for her to seek property orders. Delay by legal advisers will usually not be held against an applicant: Nygh J in Frost & Nicholson (above) at pp 76,424–5. Also Althaus [1979] FamCA 47 and Walker [1984] FamCA 55. Ignorance of the time limit or poor advice are not valid reasons to extend time: Waldmann & Paddack [2024] FedCFamC1A 100. Leave for maintenance applications out of time In Atwill [1981] FamCA 72 Nygh J at [15]-[26] discussed the principles relevant to an application for maintenance out of time and [24]-[26] referred to Whitford (above), saying: “If the wife can make out a prima facie case for maintenance, it follows almost automatically that she would suffer hardship if her claim was denied” (the mere denial of a claim for prop- erty settlement not leading automatically to a finding of hardship) ( … ) [However] an action for maintenance … arises from the inability of the applicant to support herself and the ability to pay of the respondent.",

If one of those factors is absent at the time the period of 12 months expires but accrues at a subsequent time, it cannot be said that there was any ‘delay’ in bringing action.” Note – Amendment of existing proceedings does not constitute the institution of proceedings under s 44(3) and may therefore be filed more than 12 months after divorce: Woolley [1980] FamCA 77 and Good [1982] FamCA 47. Where leave sought for both property and maintenance Evatt CJ expressed the view of the Full Court in Althaus (above) at [14] that: “If it were accepted…that the property claim should be heard, and hardship would be suffered if it were not heard, it seems in my view entirely unreasonable to split off the maintenance part of the wife’s application (which would be) to tie the hands of the Court because the issues in regard to property applications and maintenance applications are not really severable.” Nor does a cross-application (in a Response) require leave: Full Court in Good (above) at [28].

Was there fraud, duress, failure to disclose or any other circumstance? Fraud A fraudulent misrepresentation must have induced the other party to consent to the order: Nyles [2011] FamCA 565 at [188]-[192]. For more cases on “fraud” see Chapter 9 (“grounds on which the court may set aside a financial agreement”). Duress ‘Duress…need [not]…involve a direct threat of physical violence so long as there is sufficient oppres- sion…to vitiate the reality of…consent.’: Teves & Campomayor [1994] FamCA 57 at [44] applied in Robert & Golden [2011] FamCA 443. False evidence or failure to disclose The Full Court said in Morrison [1994] FamCA 153 at [32] and [42]: “The constant emphasis of the [s 79] cases is that in order for there to be a just and equitable and an appropriate order altering the interests of the parties in their property there must be a full and frank disclosure between them of all circumstances which may be relevant to the determination of their true financial position both presently and in the foreseeable future.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 74 In Barker [2007] FamCA 13 at [124] the Full Court said: “… Where there is some intervening factor known to one party, but not the other, this may lead to a result which is unfair and unjust and can be characterised as a flaw in the judicial process by which the orders were made. There may also be circumstances in which the judicial process could be impugned by a sale after orders were made and in the absence of bad faith by either party or suppression of some relevant fact, if it led to a significant miscarriage of justice.” In Simon & Michel [2010] FMCAfam 1055 a property order was set aside for H’s non-disclosure of his new job and salary package of $200,000. In Pearce [2016] FamCAFC 14 at [19]-[21] H lost his appeal against the setting aside of a consent order for his non-disclosure of an inconsistent representation he had made to a bank as to the value of an asset. Any other circumstance This applies to any situation in which a miscarriage of justice has occurred: Gebert [1990] FamCA 105 (approved in Prowse [1994] FamCA 91 at [32]) e.g. “sharp practice” where W’s draft order contained a mistake which H knew to be wrong yet he allowed the order to be made (Lowe & Harrington [1997] FamCA 14). In Hogan [2010] FMCAfam 1255 at [65]-[66] a consent order was set aside for “a combination of factors” (H’s harassment of W into signing and her “manifestly inadequate” settlement). 1.2. Did the above circumstance amount to a miscarriage of justice?

The miscarriage of justice must arise from circumstances in existence at the date of the order: Molier & Van Wyk [1980] FamCA 85 at [8]-[11]. Miscarriage of justice concerns the integrity of the judicial process. It concerns an unfair trial, not an unjust result. It does not cover orders unjustly obtained for a reason unconnected with the judicial process, such as the incompetence of counsel. In such a case a party’s remedy lies against his lawyers: Clifton & Stuart [1990] FamCA 154. Legal advice or representation may constitute miscarriage of justice if it was so bad as to be perverse or non-existent: Patching (below) cited in Hogan (above) at [40]. The Full Court in Prowse [1994] FamCA 91 at [35] approved this statement of the trial judge Strauss J: “Such [s 79A] circumstances might include lack of any or any proper representation or advice, concealment by the husband or ignorance by the wife of relevant financial matters, pressure on or undue persuasion of her, or unequal bargaining power on her part, and no doubt there may be many other such circumstances.” In a case where a wife appealed against a consent order that she said she did not know was to be a final order, the Full Court when dismissing the appeal said: “Agreement to a consent order which may not adequately reflect a party’s entitlements under s 79 does not, of itself, show that there has been a miscarriage of justice. … [The trial judge] con- cluded that the result was ‘a compromise result well within the ambit of what could have been the ultimate result in any contested hearing’.”: Holland [1982] FamCA 31 at [18]. 2.

What the Parliament is concerned with and what ought to be concerning the Court is the happening of events which cannot be reasonably foreseen, which will have the effect of causing an injustice to one of the parties if the happening of such events is not given effect to. (…) The potential insolvency of one of the parties in the future is not such a matter, in my view. In every case before the Court property values may change, go up or down, business may flourish or not flourish, the vicissitudes of life may affect one of the parties.” As to “impracticability” see Cawthorn [1998] FamCA 37; Rushby & Sherry [2004] FMCAfam 260 at [16]-[28] and Carrington (No. 2) [2010] FamCA 982.

In Cawthorn (above) an order was not dismissed for H where, despite his worsening means, he was found to have made no effort to comply with the order and enjoyed a high standard of living. Exceptional new circumstances relating to welfare of child Nygh J in Liu [1984] FamCA 65 at [30] said that “exceptional circumstances” “…need not by themselves relate to the original property order. An obvious example would be a serious chronic illness of a child which causes a need for remodelling of the house in which he or she lives which cannot be met out of increased maintenance but only out of an increased share of capital. In this case, however, the wife is seeking to enforce arrears of maintenance and may, in the light of the husband’s refusal to pay maintenance in the past, have a basis for claiming lump sum maintenance for the future. However, she could make such claims without the need to re-open the original property proceedings.” In Simpson & Hamlin [1984] FamCA 62 the Full Court approved this conclusion of the trial judge: “The occurrence of a change in the responsibility for the daily care and control of children of a marriage, after the making of a property order under s 79 of the Family Law Act could not be held of itself to be an unusual circumstance. The ordinary vicissitudes of life coupled with the difficul- ties that parties to a marriage often experience in the task of restructuring their lives following the dissolution of their marriage and the division of their assets, and their obligations to the support of each other and the support, care and control of their children, frequently creates situations in which it is desirable having regard to the children’s welfare that such",

See Hann & Green [2012] FamCA 113 at [50]-[95] for a discussion of case law and the need to prove “exceptional circumstances”, “hardship” to child or applicant and, relevant to the exercise of discretion, prejudice to the respondent.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 76 The Full Court held in Public Trustee & Gilbert [1991] FamCA 10 that the premature death of a party soon after a property order could constitute “circumstances of an exceptional nature”, but in the case before the Court those circumstances were found not to relate to the welfare of a child. Setting aside consent orders Two cases above involved a consent order – Holland; and Simpson & Hamlin. Here is another: In Anderson [1999] FamCA 1026 Chisholm J refused to set aside a consent order, sought by the husband on the ground that he had suffered loss through his wife not having disclosed her valuation of certain property. The court held that the wife was not obliged to disclose the valuation as it was privileged, and her decision not to inform the husband did not constitute suppression of evidence. He said that as the husband had not relied on any statement by the wife as to the property’s value, it could not be said that she either induced him to believe in a particular value or knew of his mistake. The husband had chosen not to value his own property, and the fact that he negotiated on a false view of its value did not indicate any improper behaviour on the part of the wife or her solicitors. See also Bigg & Suzy [1998] FamCA 14 at [6.52]. And, for a consent order set aside due to a party not disclosing a pre-settlement offer on a property, see Barker [2007] FamCA 13 at [123]. Setting aside an order by consent inferred from conduct Section 79A (1A) (s 90SN(2) for de facto claims) allows the discharge of a property order by consent.

Setting aside an order by consent inferred from conduct Section 79A (1A) (s 90SN(2) for de facto claims) allows the discharge of a property order by consent. In McCabe [1995] FamCA 147 a couple had married in 1982 and separated in early 1989. A final property order had been made by consent in July 1989. The parties reconciled and did not implement the order. They separated again in 1993 after having intermingled their financial affairs. The Full Court found that the parties had “by their conduct consented to the setting aside of the original order”, approving the following passage in Bourke (No. 2) [1994] FamCA 61: “…there is no reason to doubt that parties can expressly, by their conduct consent to the discharge of prior orders, so as to enable the court to make a fresh property order. Indeed, this would be a more likely conclusion in most cases of this type.” Also see Ozick [2012] FMCAfam 310 at [15] and [59]-[66]. The Slip Rule and other means to set aside orders A court may vary or set aside its order by consent or if the order was made ex parte, by fraud, is inter- locutory, an injunction or to appoint a receiver, does not reflect the court’s intention, there is a clerical mistake or accidental slip or omission: FLR 10.13 (in WA, FCR 311). See Higginson and Anor [2013] FamCA 902 at [5]-[8] (rectification of an error) and Xie & Zhao (No. 2) [2009] FMCAfam 1303 (ex parte order).

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 77 ENFORCEMENT OF PROPERTY ORDERS The best means to enforce an order is to anticipate the need to enforce by including in your terms of settlement self-executing enforcement remedies. Our precedent “final property orders”, for example, include default sale clauses where one party wishes to retain a property but may not obtain finance, an order for interest payable after the due date for any payment and an order for security for payment. We also include an order under s 106A enabling a registrar to sign any document. When implementing this, it is usually sufficient for a party to swear a brief affidavit annexing a copy of the order; directing the registrar’s attention to the s106A order; and setting out the attempts made to have the other party sign, their response and attaching any relevant correspondence. 1. One enforcement option is to issue an Application – Enforcement (Item 4 of FLR 2.01) to enforce an order pursuant to the court’s power to do so under s 105 FLA (with an affidavit in support), such as for default sale as above and costs. For the appointment of a trustee for sale see the order made in Kent & Marshall [2011] FamCA 232. It includes a vesting order which authorises the trustee to act (see Baker & Green & Kettle (No. 3) [2007] FamCA 1653 at [26]-[27]). While a solicitor was appointed in those cases the applicant party would usually be appointed. If you also need an order for vacant possession by the respondent see the order made in Painter-Ward & Ward [2012] FMCAfam 570.

Note – Under s 117B(1) interest on an order for payment of money is payable on the unpaid bal- ance from the date of the order or date on which the order is said to take effect, whichever is later. The rate at which interest is payable is prescribed by FLR 10.17 (in WA, FCR 313), being: (a) in respect of the period from 1 January to 30 June in any year – the rate that is 6% above the cash rate last published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before that period commenced; and (b) in respect of the period from 1 July to 31 December in any year – the rate that is 6% above the cash rate last published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before that period commenced. You need separate calculations for each half year period in each relevant year. For the relevant cash rates use this link at our eBook – www.rba.gov.au/statistics/cash-rate/. Add to your orders sought the daily rate of interest payable beyond the order made. 2. Issue an Application – Contravention AND at the hearing seek (1) a sanction for non-compliance with a financial order under Part XIIIA FLA (s 112AD(1) in particular) and (2) orders under s 112AD(4) as are “necessary to ensure compliance”. Those orders may only be made if a sanction has been imposed. And seek (3) costs on an indemnity basis caused by the respondent’s breach of the order: see the Colgate case under “costs” in Chapter 8. The applicant’s affidavit in support should itemise the interest and costs sought (and include a copy of their costs agreement).

For a discussion of the cases see Markham [2010] FamCA 460 at [98]-[101]. In Davidson (No. 2) [1994] FamCA 33 a company which the court had earlier found to be the hus- band’s alter ego executed a deed of variation of a trust deed that removed him as appointor of the trust. The Full Court held that the trial judge was right to identify the deed of variation as a step in a scheme to defeat the earlier court order and to set aside the deed of variation. The husband was also ordered to execute an agreement nominating an accountant nominated by the wife to act as appointor of the trust, that order being available under s 80 by virtue of s 106B(4A).

Also see Vedders & Gittens [2023] FedCFamC1A 138 at [38]. • Transactions in normal course of business—Distributions many months before the issue of proceedings to two adult children from a family trust controlled by H were not set aside by Treyvaud J in Gelley (No. 2) [1992] FamCA 84 as the distributions would not affect the anticipated order; they were normal and prudent; could have been taken into account",

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 80 EFFECT OF DEATH ON PROPERTY PROCEEDINGS Section 79(8) (and s 90SM(8) for de facto claims) provides that where a party dies before property proceedings are completed: (a) Such proceedings may be continued by or against the personal representative of a deceased party. (b) The court may make a property order it would have made had the party not died, if still appropriate. (c) Such an order is enforceable by or against the deceased party’s estate. As to whether it is “still appropriate” to make a property order after the death of a party see Erdem & Ozsoy [2012] FMCAfam 1323 at [131]-[133]. The proceedings need only be filed, not filed and served, before death for these sections to apply: Nantz & Brettos [2011] FMCAfam 427. The Full Court in Tasmanian Trustees Ltd & Gleeson [1990] FamCA 65 upheld Wood J’s decision that it was no longer appropriate to make an order in favour of the deceased husband’s estate relating to the jointly owned home, 70% of which the husband had claimed due to his extreme illness. As the estate was small, and the wife had made substantial contributions and had overwhelming needs, it was held that the usual moral entitlement of a deceased’s legal representative to the deceased’s contribution- based share (and the freedom to dispose of it by will to strangers to the marriage) should not apply. The home therefore became vested in the wife by survivorship. A case of a larger estate, where the estate did receive the deceased’s due entitlement, was Menzies & Evans [1988] FamCA 35.

The court can now make a property order even though property has vested in the bankruptcy trustee of a party, altering the interests of the trustee in the vested bankruptcy property: s 79(1)(b) Such an order may require the trustee to transfer property to the non-bankrupt spouse: 79(1)(d)(ii) The bankruptcy trustee may be joined as a party to proceedings in which a property order is sought and a party was a bankrupt or, before completion of proceedings, a party becomes a bankrupt: s 79(11) The trustee may also, upon the application of the non-bankrupt spouse, be restrained from distributing dividends among creditors: s 114(4). So may the trustee of a personal insolvency agreement: s 114(6) Upon a bankruptcy trustee becoming a party, the bankrupt party is not entitled to make a submission to the court in connection with any vested bankruptcy property: s 79(12).

A person granted leave to in- tervene is deemed to be a party to the proceedings with all the rights, duties and liabilities of a party: s 92(3). The court has the power to make a property order (s 79) or grant an injunction (s 114) “that is directed to, or alters the rights, liabilities or property interests of a third party”: s 90AA.

See s 90AD which gives the court jurisdiction to determine liabilities as well as make orders in relation to property. The orders the court can make against a creditor or other third party are set out in s 90AE(1): (a) an order directed to a creditor of the parties to substitute one party for both parties in relation to the debt (b) an order directed to a creditor of one party to substitute the other party, or both parties, in relation to the debt (c) an order directed to a creditor of the parties that the parties be liable for a different proportion of the debt (d) an order directed to a director of a company or to a company to register a transfer of shares from one party to the other party.

W knew the home was bought in her name because H was having trouble with creditors, but it had not been put to her that she knew the purchase money should have been paid to meet H’s tax debt. The ATO relied on s 90AE(3)(d) but the Full Court held that the section related to: “[79] … the Court’s direct interference with a third party’s rights, for example, in respect of a creditor, rights relating to the person from whom recovery may be sought. In contrast, the aspect of a creditor’s position to which the Court must have regard under s 75(2)(ha) are not rights to recovery but the practical prospects of recovery from a debtor spouse’s property. [80] For example, one might imagine a circumstance where one spouse’s initial contributions and the shortness of the marriage might mean that the great bulk of property existing at the time of a property settlement trial had belonged to, and does belong to, that spouse and that position ought not be altered under s 79. In the meantime, a creditor might have lent, perhaps unwisely, to the other spouse, who lost the borrowed money and could not repay from his or her own assets. As we have said, we do not think that in such circumstances, either s 79(2) or s 75(2)(ha) has the result that the creditor has some opportunity, on the basis of justice and eq- uity, of improving the position that the creditor would have been in had he pursued the debtor spouse alone.

The opinion of a valuer is expert evidence, which is governed by Part 7.1 FLR (or, in WA, Division 5 of Part 15 FCR).. Leave is required to rely on any expert evidence that is not the evidence of a single expert witness: FLR 7.10 (in WA, FCR 274). It follows that before obtaining any valuation, the other side should be consulted and agreement reached as to the appointment of a valuer, so as to appoint him or her as a single expert witness (and thereby make the evidence admissible without leave). The pre-action letter should nominate three potential experts, and request the other side to select one (see “letters” below). If agreement cannot be reached, directions can be sought from the Court at the first court event. All instructions to an expert witness must be in writing. The expert is to be given a copy of Divisions 7.1.4, 7.1.5 and 7.1.6 FLR, with notice that the report may be used in a proceeding and a description of the issues about which the opinion is sought: FLR 7.13 (in WA, FCR 279). If a single expert valuer is appointed, but your client is not happy with the report, then: • the report may be clarified via conference (FLR 7.25).

The following are the forms of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Applicants • Superannuation Information Kit Before preparing your court papers, have your client complete details on pages 4 and 5 of the document (leave the rest blank, those pages are for the trustee to complete) and forward to the trustee of your client’s superannuation fund. This applies where a party has a superannuation interest, regardless of the type of order being sought and also applies to Applications for Consent Orders. Either attach the completed Kit to your client’s Financial Statement when you file it or file and serve the completed Kit separately, no later than the first court date. See FLR 6.06. • Initiating Application (Family Law) This form may be used for marital or de facto property claims. Insert the final and any interim orders from “precedents” below. Interim orders would be necessary for such orders as an injunction, preser- vation of assets and interim costs. An interim order can be sought after an Initiating Application has been filed by filing an Application in a Proceeding (see “forms”) and an affidavit explaining why the interim order is sought. • Financial Statement Attach a page of expenses not covered by the court form (“financial statement addendum” in “precedents”) and at Part O of the Financial Statement, insert “see attached”. Attach completed Superannuation Information Kit to your Financial Statement if applicable and available. • Affidavit An affidavit should not be filed until you are directed to do so except in support of an interim ap- plication.

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 113 General notes on drafting 1. The splitting of superannuation occurs through the combined operation of two sets of laws. The first set of laws is, of course, the Family Law Act 1975. The second set of laws is the law governing the prudential regulation of superannuation, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated regulations as well as the governing rules of the superannuation trusts. 2. All splitting orders require provisions derived from the first set of laws, the Family Law Act 1975. These might be called the mandatory elements. 3. However, provisions in a splitting order relying on superannuation law are not mandatory but may be used depending on the type of superannuation involved. Trustees of superannuation in an accumulation plan are required to observe the operating standards of Part 7A of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. Trustees of superannuation in a defined benefit plan are bound by the terms of the governing rules of the superannuation trust. 4. Superannuation splitting for de factos in WA is pursuant to Part VIIIC of the Act. See at p 7-56A a schedule of the equivalent legislative provisions when drafting orders and agreements that include such a split. The mandatory elements – the Family Law Act requirements 1. The power of a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to superannuation is a power to split payments (s 90XS). 2. The court does not have the power to order the superannuation trustee to split the underlying superannuation interest. All splitting orders must therefore be made in accordance with that limitation on the court’s power (s 90XT). 3. The trustee of the superannuation plan is a third party to the marriage but is not bound by the terms of the payment splitting order unless",

The trustee of the superannuation plan is a third party to the marriage but is not bound by the terms of the payment splitting order unless the trustee has been accorded procedural fairness (s 90XZD). 4. The court may make one of three types of payment splitting orders (the first two will be the most frequently used): a. an order which allocates an amount (“the base amount”) – this may be referred to as a type (a) order because it is an order made in accordance with s 90XT(1)(a); b. an order which prescribes a percentage – this may be referred to as a type (b) order because it is an order made in accordance with s 90XT(1)(b); c. an order which prescribes a percentage for the percentage-only interests – this may be referred to as a type (c) order because it is an order made in accordance with s 90XT(1)(c). However, these orders will be quite rare as they would only apply to a few judicial, parliamentary and governors’ superannuation schemes. 5. The four required elements of a payment splitting order are as follows: a. Allocate the base amount or prescribe the percentage, depending on whether the order is a type (a) or a type (b) order; b.

Order that the superannuation trustee is to: i. calculate the entitlement of the non-member spouse in accordance with the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations 2025; ii. pay that entitlement whenever the trustee makes a splittable payment (this is the part of the order that binds the trustee); iii. set the operative time. The optional elements – superannuation law 1. Part 7A of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 requires that trustees of superannuation in an accumulation plan must, upon service of a payment splitting order made under the Family Law Act, create a new interest for the non-member spouse (“the non-member spouse interest”). 2. The trustee is then required to give the non-member spouse three options in relation to that interest: a. Retain that new entitlement for the non-member spouse in that plan; b. Rollover or transfer the entitlement to another complying superannuation plan; or c. Pay the entitlement to the non-member spouse but only if the non-member spouse has met a superannuation condition of release. 3. Trustees of superannuation in a defined benefit plan are not governed by Part 7A of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations but they are required to observe the governing rules of the superannuation trust. These rules may or may not have been amended to mirror the pathway under Part 7A of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations for accumulation plans. It will depend on the particular superannuation plan in question. 4. There are optional elements that may be added to a super splitting order to cover the superannuation law elements in the splitting process. These optional clauses of an order would be in personam orders to define the pathway for a clean break using both family law and superannuation law. 5.

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 123 Self-managed superannuation The splitting of a super entitlement in a self-managed super fund (SMSF) can be complex, especially where the structures and investments within the super fund are complex and elaborate. There may be a unit trust structure over the super fund or the fund may have business premises as an investment either with or without a unit trust. The splitting of this form of super not only involves the payment splitting pro- visions under the FLA but also considerations of how to split the investments of the SMSF. In general, the precedent orders set out above for super interests held in an accumulation plan can be applied to the self-managed context since super in a self-managed plan is accumulation style super. However, if you are in any doubt about how to deal with this form of superannuation or the split departs from a standard cash transfer to another complying superannuation fund, seek specialist advice (either from your barrister or a specialist recommended by your counsel) to avoid having to notify your insurer about a possible negligence claim. Explain to your client that complex superannuation involves specialist advice about how to disentangle the fund. A typical self-managed superannuation plan will have the husband and wife as members. The entitle- ments will typically be disparate. Part of the settlement may be that one of the parties agrees to leave the superannuation fund and rollover their entitlement to another complying superannuation fund. An order to achieve this (to be added to any splitting order) follows: 1. That the [husband/wife] do all such acts and things and sign all such documents, including but not limited to the signing of trustee minutes, rollover requests and related documents, that may be necessary to rollover or transfer the entitlement of the [husband/wife]",

The type of order will depend on the type of superannuation being paid – account based pensions or defined benefit pensions. Account based pensions (or allocated pensions) Account based pensions are paid from a superannuation account which has a sum invested with sufficient liquidity so that the amount available for draw down is within the prescribed band under superannuation law. Superannuation law prescribes that the rate of draw down must be between 4% and 10% per annum of the lump sum invested to fund the pension. Once the lump sum is exhausted, the pension ceases. An order for the splitting of an account based pension will identify the amount or the percentage of the invested lump sum to be allocated to the non-member spouse. The type (a) order or a base amount order (an order made in accordance with s 90XT(1)(a) of the Family Law Act) may be used. In the alternative, the type (b) order or a percentage order (an order made in accordance with s 90XT(1)(b)) may be used. Type (a) order 1.

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN 7 – 126 Defined benefit pensions A defined benefit pension will typically be paid by a State, Territory or Federal Government superannuation scheme. Judicial and parliamentary pensions as well as public service pensions are examples. Lawyers may also find examples of defined benefit pensions in payment where the member was employed as an executive in a large corporation. Where the order is an order to split the ongoing payments of the defined benefit pension, the order of choice is the type (b) order or the percentage order. However, care should be taken in cases where the governing rules of the defined benefit superannuation plan have been amended to require the trustee to create separate pension entitlement. The new entitlement may be actuarially determined and the annual amount may not be the same as the member’s amount because of age and gender differences in the actuarial calculations. Lawyers should also note that the operative time is 7 days after service of the order on the trustee on the basis that the computer systems of the superannuation administration may need additional time to commence the splitting of the pension payments. The following is an order to split the ongoing pension payments. 1. That, in accordance with section 90XT(1)(b) of the Family Law Act 1975: a. the [`97`] (or the [`97`]’s administrators, executors, beneficiaries, heirs or assigns) is entitled to be paid the specified percentage out of the [`98`]’s interest in the [`99`] Superannuation Fund; b. the [`98`]’s entitlement (or the entitlement of such other person to whom a payment may be made out of the [`98`]’s interest) in the [`99`] Superannuation Fund, is correspondingly reduced by force of this Order; and c. the percentage specified for the purposes of this Order is [`101`]%. 2.

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 127 Flagging orders The flagging order is an order to prevent the trustee from making any splittable payments while the flag is in place. It may be used where the member is on the cusp of payment and there is concern that the member may abscond with the superannuation. While it is called a “flagging order”, the text of the section directs the trustee not to make any splittable payments. An example follows: 1. That in accordance with section 90XU(1)(a) of the Family Law Act 1975, the trustee of the [`99`] superannuation fund is directed not to make any splittable payments out of the [`98`]’s interest in the [`99`] superannuation fund without leave of the Court. 2. The [`98`] shall notify the [`97`] within twenty-eight (28) days prior to making an application to the Trustee for any payment out of the [`98`]’s interest in the [`99`] superannuation fund. 3. That in accordance with section 90XU(1)(b) of the Family Law Act 1975, the Trustee of the [`99`] superannuation fund is to notify the Court within the period specified in the immediately succeeding clause of this order of the next occasion that a splittable payment becomes payable out of the [`98`]’s interest in the [`99`] superannuation fund. 4. That the period specified for the purposes of the immediately preceding clause of this order is a period which commences 14 days prior to the next occasion that a splittable payment becomes payable out of the ‘98’s interest in the ’99’ superannuation fund and ceases 14 days after that occasion.

In Zoller [2012] FamCA 47 Murphy J granted an ex parte flagging order under s 90XU due to the pros- pect of the husband withdrawing super from his pension plan, being “a substantial part of the property of the parties”. Editor’s note as to operative time The “operative time” for a split differs between orders and superannuation agreements: s 90XD. The section defines the operative time for a split under an order as “the time specified in the or- der” (Stephen Bourke’s view being that that time should be the time of valuation). A split under an agreement “has the meaning given by s 90XI”, which prescribes “the beginning of the fourth busi- ness day after the day on which a copy of the agreement is served on the trustee” as the operative time. The courts, however, have been seen to be making orders in which the operative time is the fourth business day after service of the order on the trustee (with the result that trustees have begun requiring draft orders to be so worded). Stephen Bourke (author of the above precedents) sees at least three problems with this approach. 1. If a non-member should die between the order and the operative time 4 business days after service of the order i.e after the court (having made a final order) is functus officio, s 90XZC (which allows a payment split where a non-member dies after the operative time for a split to be implemented by the executor of the deceased’s estate or to continue if it has been imple- mented) would not keep the split alive for non-members who die after the court is functus officio but before the order is operative.

Depending on: a) the date of valuation; b) the time that has elapsed between valuation and implementation; c) the type of fund; and d) the investment returns secured by the trustee. setting the operative time 4 business days after service will have financial consequences for both the member and the non-member. In accumulation plans, the non-member will be disadvantaged in times of positive returns and the member will be disadvantaged in times of negative returns. In defined benefit superannuation, the non-member will be disadvantaged. And in self-managed superannuation funds the loss will depend on a comparison between investment returns and the statutory rate under Reg 45D of the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations 2025. 3. The third issue, Stephen says, is that it is not unknown for lawyers to overlook serving the order on the trustee. This means that where the operative time under an order is linked to service of the order, the order may in some cases never become operative or not become operative for some time. Stephen suggests that where trustees require a “4 business days” operative time you advise them that you will comply with their request if they agree in writing to pay the damages to the party who may be disadvantaged as well as the cost of any litigation to remedy the consequences of Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 occurring (the death of the non-member before their required operative time and investment losses). As for Scenario 3, your use of precedents that link the operative time to service of the order could be a liability headache for you if service of the order on the trustee is overlooked. The above precedents have been amended by Stephen Bourke in respect of “operative time” with a view to avoiding these problems.",

      "text": "PROPERTY 7 – 129 AFFIDAVITS (MARITAL AND DE FACTO) A suggestion about affidavits Being the sworn evidence of the person making it, filed in support of a party’s case, an affidavit should use the witness’s simple everyday language, not your own legalese. The precedent sub-headings should help guide you through the relevant facts and issues involved. An affidavit in support of an application for interim orders may include hearsay evidence (“I was told by…”) if the deponent states their source of information, but an affidavit in support of final orders does not allow that and the offending statements would be struck out as being inadmissible. Opinion and feelings are not allowed (except from an expert witness), so avoid “I believe…”, “I feel...” and “I submit…” and for the sake of credibility, check all your figures with care. Feel free to email your draft affidavit and orders sought to counsel to settle before you file them. See a paper “Affidavits, Objectionable material in” by Newcastle barrister John Hamilton at our online members’ Archive. A note about the following precedents As the first affidavit below (after the Financial Statement Addendum sheet) includes sample evidence for different interim (and final) orders, simply delete what you do not need. The affidavit may be filed either with an Application or a Response. Leave to proceed out of time is an interim order, so your application should also seek the final orders your client will be seeking if leave is granted. Its affidavit in support is set out below. Variation of a property order is a final order.

A tip Because your local State Magistrates Court may also receive such an application (check first that it still has a family law list), some lawyers make it a practice of filing an Application for Consent Orders there instead. Before doing so, however, consider the implications of s 47A(1) of the FLA (this does not apply to a family law magistrate of WA: s 47A(2)). Section 47A provides that: • a party to an order from a court of summary jurisdiction can appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) • they may do so within 28 days (FLR 13.03) • such an appeal is as of right (no grounds of appeal need to be established) • the matter will be heard de novo (afresh, not limited to a point of law) The fact that the order was made by consent is not a valid objection to a rehearing: Robinson & Willis [1982] FamCA 16. You can avoid giving disgruntled parties an easy avenue for changing their mind by filing all your Applications for Consent Orders in the FCFCA or FCWA. Effect of delay in filing the Application A respondent’s consent to an application for consent orders lapses if 90 days have passed since the date of the first affidavit in the Application: FLR 10.08 In the event of such delay between signature by the parties, the first party should re-swear their affidavit prior to the second party signing.

A subpoena is an order requiring a person to produce documents (to the court by the specified date) or give evidence (or both), the first of those being the most often used in family law. The former enables you to get documents from a person who has refused to provide them. Or you will be looking for potential corroboration of your client’s case as to family violence or child abuse, or per- haps previous psychiatric treatment of the other party, prior convictions, child protection records and so on; or in a financial case, business records of some kind. The form The FCFCA’s form is here at our eBook and at our online “forms & precedents”. The FCWA’s form is at “forms” at our online practice news (“FCWA”). For their text, see “precedent subpoenas to produce documents” below. Tips for completion of subpoena • State the name of the person the subpoena is directed to, or their position, ensuring that they are authorised to act on behalf of their organisation. • Specify exactly each document to be produced (i.e. not “all documents relating to…”) How and when to file it • In the FCFCA (not the FCWA) subpoenas (except up to 5 subpoenas to produce documents at an interim hearing) may only be issued if the Court has granted permission. • In the FCFCA upload your completed subpoena to produce in the Cth Courts Portal via its interactive prompt screen (it generates a cover sheet and includes payment options for the filing fee). Court fees here and, for FCWA, here. • For all other subpoenas (and all FCWA subpoenas) email the completed subpoena to the registry with a credit card payment form and, for FCWA,",

      "text": "OTHER ROUTINE PROCEDURES 8 – 11 Inspection (and copying) of documents A subpoena is only listed to hear an objection (see overleaf). A party or ICL may inspect and obtain copies without leave if the subpoena was served on the named person, any interested person and any ICL at least 10 days before its production date, no objection was filed, the subpoena was complied with and a Notice of Request to Inspect are filed (child welfare, crimi- nal, medical and police records require leave to copy): FLR 6.37. Compliance may be by copies unless an original has been subpoenaed: FLR 6.39 (in WA, FCA 255). Non-compliance can mean a warrant for the named person’s arrest and an order that they pay the costs caused by failure to comply: FLR 6.41 (in WA, FCR 261). Cost of complying with subpoena if not a party The FCFCA may order the issuing party to pay a subpoenaed third party their cost of compliance if, before complying, that party has given the issuing party notice that “substantial loss or expense would be incurred in properly complying with the subpoena” (and given an estimate of that expense) and the court is satisfied of such cost and fixes the amount payable: FLR 6.35 (in WA, FCR 250) (the amount payable is in addition to any conduct money). In Markoska and Anor (Costs) [2011] FamCA 833 Murphy J said at [57]-[63]: “[‘Substantial loss or expense’] means that the expense must be large causing loss; it must be unusual in the sense of requiring normal activity to be stopped; or it must cause an unfair incon- venience having regard to the fact that the recipient has nothing to do with the litigation.

( … ) in a large organisation, the capacity to cover the expense is greater than in a small organisation ( … ) the rules are not intended to put the individual presenting the documents in a position where they lose income or capital … and each situation must be determined on its peculiar facts ( … ) Thus, in a case where a professional fee is claimed or the bobcat driver claims significant hours of ‘downtime’, the question still remains whether the finding, collecting, collating, marshalling and producing the documents or materials required the attention of the owner, partner or professional or whether it could be done by a clerical person … with … professional oversight.” Cronin J said in Moriarty [2009] FamCA 369 at [54]: “ … there is nothing in the rules nor should there be that gives any profession or business sector a right to claim expenses based upon their respective scales or charges. It is inappropriate for a court to look at those scales as anything more than a guide.” Carmody J said in G & D & D [2005] FamCA 1429 at [18] that compensation had been held “to include recovery of the costs of legal advice and representation in relation to documents under subpoena”. In Lavell [2012] FamCA 34 at [250]-[261] an accountant’s $4,000 claim was reduced to $1,000.

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 12 Objections to produce Possible objections are privilege; relevance (not a fishing exercise); abuse of process (not by being used as an alternative to discovery); oppressiveness; and lack of conduct money, late service or defective wording. For a summary of the law and the court’s approach see O’Hara & Ors [2007] FamCA 1346 at [26]-[40]. Privilege may be claimed if the document was made for the dominant purpose of litigation or obtaining legal advice: Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122. Privilege attaches to documents, not files. Legal professional privilege belongs to the client, not the lawyer (Mullen & De Bry & Anor [2007] FMCAfam 10 at [19]). The client should be asked whether privilege is waived and, if not, the objection made. Care should be taken to ensure privilege is not waived: Bell [2009] FMCAfam 595. In Mark & Messina [2009] FamCA 1021 M who deposed to her state of mind (anxiety) about her child’s relationship with F being formed by her discussions with her lawyers was held to have impliedly waived her right of legal privilege, requiring production of her lawyer’s file relating to the advice given on that issue. See also Dargan & Chesnik [2010] FMCAfam 726 at [18]-[35]. A person whose medical records have been subpoenaed may by notice in writing to the registrar before the production deadline seek to inspect those records so as to consider whether to object to inspec- tion or copying. Inspection may occur 7 days after the production deadline or the determination of an objection: FLR 6.38 (in WA, FCR 257). For a discussion of whether the benefit of relevant evidence should prevail over doctor/patient confidentiality see Jermyn & Carling [2012] FMCAfam 814 from [44].

In Vitalis & Kazan (No 2) [2022] FedCFamC1F 601 it was held that the public and children’s interest in having relevant evidence regarding a parent’s mental health outweighed the parent’s right to privacy. The question is not admissibility but “apparent relevance”: Hatton & Attorney General of the Common- wealth & CBA [2000] FamCA 892 (also as to whether a subpoena is an abuse of process or oppressive i.e. an unreasonable burden on its recipient). Also see Deffia & Zuddro and Ors [2008] FamCA 643 at [9]-[14]. In MacDowell & Williams and Ors [2012] FamCA 479 the wills of W’s parents who had not lost testamentary capacity and documents of a company in which they were directors but had no proprietary interest were held not to be discoverable. Determining an objection is evaluative but a party’s access to documents is discretionary: Pedersen [2024] FedCFamC1A 229 at [53]-[54]. A subpoena should not be used as an alternative to discovery: Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at [572]-[575]. See the law and correct procedure for “discovery of docu- ments” in this chapter. Compliance is not required if the Rules have not been complied with as to service or payment of con- duct money: FLR 6.41 (in WA, FCR 261).

      "text": "OTHER ROUTINE PROCEDURES 8 – 13 If acting for an objector it is suggested that in a letter to the lawyer for the issuing party you enclose the sealed Notice of Objection and: • refer to the attached table as identifying each document in question and the reason for your objection; • estimate the likely costs to argue the matter in court and say that those costs will be sought at the hearing if necessary; • invite the lawyer to release your client from compliance under FLR 6.32 (in WA, FCA 252); and • confirm a timeframe after which it will be assumed that the lawyer is insisting on compliance despite the objection, and that costs will be incurred thereafter. If necessary, brief counsel to appear at the hearing. The subpoenaed documents should be copied (but not provided to the other party) and brought to the hearing unless alleged oppressiveness makes that impracticable. File an affidavit to prove any relevant facts behind the objections. For privilege, the court must be satis- fied that each document in respect of which privilege is claimed was made for the dominant purpose of litigation or obtaining legal advice. Detailed evidence must be filed which sets out how the documents came into existence such that the court can make a finding as to its dominant purpose. A general asser- tion that merely asserts that a document was created for the dominant purpose of litigation or obtaining legal advice is unlikely to support an objection: Strahan [2013] FamCAFC 203.

File a further affidavit specifying the costs incurred in complying with the subpoena, so that an order for costs can be sought at the hearing. Annex the correspondence between you and the other lawyer as to the subpoena. Documents in the possession of another court Under FLR 6.28 (in WA, FCR 259) the procedure for obtaining documents from another court is not by subpoena but by writing to your registrar, giving the name and address of the court in possession of the document; a description of the document to be produced; when the document is to be produced; and the reason for seeking production. The registrar will then ask that court to send the document to the registry by a specified date. A party may then apply for leave to inspect and copy. Centrelink, ATO and Child Support documents Centrelink, ATO and Child Support Registrar are not required to comply with a subpoena to produce documents. Centrelink relies on s 207 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) (also see Piras & Thaisawat [1993] FamCA 106); ATO (secrecy and/or privacy provisions); and Child Support Registrar under ss 16(5) CSR&CA and 150(5) CSAA (unless the documents sought are in relation to child support proceedings). Your recourse in such a case would include issuing a subpoena against, say the relevant person’s accountant for tax records. Because the person whose social security and child support information is being held is entitled to receive same (by FOI request, if necessary) your option there is to apply to the court for discovery of related documents by the respondent.

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 14 PRECEDENT SUBPOENAS Your approach to issuing subpoenas In Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 572-575 Jordan CJ stated some principles which have been widely followed in family law proceedings: “A subpoena to a stranger must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced. ( … ) It is not legitimate to use a subpoena as a substitute for an application for further and better particulars, or for discovery of documents.” Note – In parenting cases where family violence or welfare risk is alleged (including cases in the Evatt List) the Court routinely makes orders under s 67ZBE for the Police Commissioner or child welfare department to produce all documents in their possession as to the parents and child/ren. Once made, the Court sends such orders to each department, then informs the parties when docu- ments are produced. Where there is a limit of 5 subpoenas for interim hearings, consider seeking a s 67ZBE order, rather than seeking a subpoena to the Police or child welfare department.

In Black & Kellner [1992] FamCA 2 at [25] the Full Court referred with approval to the following remarks of Smithers J in the case of Briese: “I believe that the conclusion of the House of Lords in the case of Livesey v Jenkins is apposite, namely, that in financial proceedings between spouses, each party must make a full and frank dis- closure of all material facts. In that case it was made clear that full and frank disclosure of all mate- rial facts was required as a matter of principle in the light of the fact that it was the duty of the court, taking into account a number of designated criteria, to make a decision which basically involved the exercise of discretion. This is quite different from common law litigation between strangers in which such a general duty does not exist, and obligations would only exist insofar as statute or court rules required. In my view it is fundamental to the whole operation of the Family Law Act in financial cases, that there is an obligation of the nature to which I have referred.” Disclosure in parenting cases The duty of disclosure applies here too. Discoverable documents include a party’s criminal records, documents filed in relevant intervention order proceedings, a child’s or party’s medical records and school reports: FLR 6.05.

As to the latter, should the other party seek a document from your client that is not in your client’s possession or under their control or is irrelevant to an issue in the case or is subject to a claim of privilege, you should arrange for your client to swear an affidavit as to those circumstances. In Schweitzer [2012] FamCA 445 O’Reilly J dismissed W’s application for disclosure by H of the financial statements, tax returns and bank statements for two discretionary trusts and the minutes of the corporate trustee as to trust distributions, holding that as the trustee company was not a “one man company” the documents sought could not be said to be under the husband’s “control” within the meaning of FLR 6.03.

Consequences of non-disclosure If a party does not disclose a document as required by these Rules they must not offer the document, or present evidence of its contents, at a hearing without the other party’s consent or the court’s permission; may be guilty of contempt for not disclosing the document; may be ordered to pay costs; and the court may stay or dismiss all or part of the party’s case: FLR 6.17 (in WA, FCR 210).

An option for uncooperative respondents In seeking discovery of a document from an uncooperative party, you could give notice of intention to apply for “a Weir Order”, being the Full Court’s ruling in Weir [1992] FamCA 69 at [33] where the Court said: “It seems to us that once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure…then the Court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. To do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature.” Cases since have consistently taken the approach of assuming that a party failing to make full and frank disclosure has property that is being hidden. In Chang & Su [2002] FamCA 156 the Full Court dismissed an appeal against the decision of the trial judge (Moore J) who, satisfied that the husband had not disclosed his property interests in Taiwan, awarded the wife the entire asset pool in Australia, unencumbered, despite there being limited evidence as",

In Gerber [2010] FamCA 861 Coleman J, applying Weir (above), notionally increased the $1.6m asset pool by $500,000 in reliance upon benefits derived after separation by the (non-disclosing) husband from a business in which he had an interest. Another option is to foreshadow that you will be seeking an undefended hearing if the non- disclosure persists: see Melville & Dent [2008] FamCA 926.

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 26 APPLYING FOR AN ORDER FOR INTERIM COSTS (INCLUDING EXPERT WITNESS EXPENSES) Note – This section has been left until nearly last in this chapter as the editors do not recommend your taking this action except as a last resort. It will be far better all round if you were to amicably negotiate a mutual release of funds towards each party’s costs and outlays. See the comments on this below, and under “partial property settlements” in the chapter “property”. Introduction No later than their second appointment with you, give your clients a rough idea of their future costs if the matter does not settle but proceeds to a final hearing (see chapter “client preliminaries” under “initial consultation” and “the second appointment”), and discuss with them how they intend to meet those costs. It is when your client has access to insufficient funds with which to finance your representation and the preparation of their case that it becomes necessary to review the merits of a court application for an order for those costs to be paid by the other party or from liquid or realisable assets under that party’s control. Is there a better option? Yes. The disadvantages of such an application are that, being adversarial by nature, it would be contested; is expensive, say, $5–15,000 including counsel (see its involved procedure below); may not result in as much as was sought; and may fail (good money then being thrown after bad). For these reasons, it is common for lawyers to negotiate with each other at an early stage of discussions the advance to each lawyer of a negotiated amount – say $20–30,000 – from available funds (such as a joint or investment account, or by the sale of a non-essential asset) towards each party’s future costs",

If the other party should come to you with such a proposal, agree to it. There can be no prejudice to either party, there is only mutual benefit. A “strictly business” approach like this, on non-adversarial lines and on the basis of the advance being a partial property settlement that is brought into account at the end of the case, will usually produce ready agreement from the other party’s lawyer (and even an unrepresented party, who would usually have needs other than legal costs) who will see the mutual advantage to be gained by such an arrangement. It is best to try for as much of your client’s future costs and outlays as you can, to avoid having to keep returning to the other party’s lawyer for further advances. Partial property settlement This is also called a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, where part of the asset pool is advanced for the benefit of either party or both of them. The amounts are notionally added back to the pool and deducted from each party’s ultimate share in the property settlement. Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

In obtaining such a loan, the client would incur administration fees and pay interest, but the application process would be quicker, more predictable and possibly cheaper than running a Hogan application. You would, of course, be required by the lender to satisfy yourself as to the terms and conditions of the loan, and some lenders will only provide funds if the borrower’s law firm guarantees re-payment. Court action as a last resort The court has the power under both ss 80(1)(h) and (k) and 117(2) of the FLA to make an order requir- ing a party to provide the other with the funds necessary to be able to prosecute their case: Zschokke [1996] FamCA 79 at [71]-[72]. The purpose of the remedy is to ensure that there is a “level playing field” between the litigants, pending trial. This type of application is known as an application for interim costs, or “Hogan Order” (the leading case being Hogan [1986] FamCA 34) (AKA a Barro order, after another case on the same issue). Ordinarily a “Hogan Order” is an order that: • the respondent pay a lump sum to the applicant (or the applicant’s solicitors’ trust account) towards their legal costs; or that • the parties do all acts necessary to sell an asset so as to realise a lump sum, and then pay such sum either to the applicant (or the applicant’s solicitors’ trust account) towards their legal costs. In Wicklow [2007] FamCA 840, Steele J heard an application for a review of an order of Johnston JR that the husband pay the wife towards her costs the same sum he had paid his own lawyers for his, the wife’s application being",

In Wicklow [2007] FamCA 840, Steele J heard an application for a review of an order of Johnston JR that the husband pay the wife towards her costs the same sum he had paid his own lawyers for his, the wife’s application being that he pay her $100,000 for her interim costs. Steele J found that that sum was not really in dispute, but that the parties disagreed as to how those funds should be realised. It was found that there were ample assets, such as four valuable cars any of which could realise the amount required. The court was also willing to make an equivalent order for each party if that were desired. For an interim costs order to fund an application to set aside a financial agreement see Salvage & Fosse [2020] FamCAFC 144. There, Ryan and Aldridge JJ said that the “critical question … is whether the ap- plicant has ‘any real prospects of obtaining justice unless the [interim costs] order sought is made’” ([14]) and that the Court must assess “the nature and quality of any property claim” including “the likely divi- sion” and whether the proceedings are justified by “the nature and quality of the claim” and “the likely costs involved” ([25]).

Threshold requirements To succeed with such an application, the applicant must satisfy the following threshold matters: • There must be a disparity in the parties’ financial positions to the extent that the respondent controls the parties’ assets, while the applicant does not have access such that they are unable to meet their legal costs pending trial; and • The respondent to the application has the capacity to meet their own legal costs; and • The applicant’s case for a final property settlement has merit – i.e. the amount sought by the applicant is less than the amount the applicant is likely to receive by way of final property settlement; and • The applicant’s needs (in terms of actual costs and disbursements incurred to the date of the hearing and anticipated costs in preparing the matter for trial) are in evidence before the court.

The Full Court’s ruling on interim costs Strahan (Interim Property Orders) [2009] FamCAFC 166 concerned an asset pool of $80m+ where the wife had spent $11m in legal costs, largely in pursuit of the husband for non-disclosure of valuable assets. Previous interim costs orders enabled half of that expense, the wife’s latest application for such costs being for $5m as an interim property order. The trial judge reduced her award for those costs to $1m. The Court upheld the wife’s appeal, allowing the $5m sought by her, holding: • That an interim costs order may be made as a maintenance order under ss 72 and 74; as a property settlement under ss 79 and 80(1)(h); or as a costs order under s 117 • That the source of power should be identified so as to ascertain the Act’s prerequisites for the interim costs order • That more than one such order may be made in the course of s 79 proceedings to fund the legal costs of a party Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",

It did not require a detailed inquiry into the conduct of the litigation on the part of the Wife (…) As…the trial Judge was satisfied that the Wife needed funds to meet ongoing legal costs of the proceedings and that she did not have the funds to pay those costs…it was an appropriate case to exercise the jurisdiction to make an interim order for property settlement.” In Osferatu [2012] FamCA 408 at para 35 Watts J said: “The notion of a ‘level playing field’ is one which almost axiomatically is in the interests of justice and an important matter to consider when deciding whether it would be appropriate to make an interim property order.” Procedure The procedure to obtain such a Hogan Order is: 1.

For the wording of an undertaking in damages see FLR 10.18(5) (in WA, FCR 316(4)).

      "text": "OTHER ROUTINE PROCEDURES 8 – 41 APPOINTMENT OF LITIGATION GUARDIAN A person under a disability may only start, continue, respond or seek to intervene in a case by their litigation guardian in the FCFCA (FLR 3.13) or case guardian in the FCWA (FCR 103). Such a person is defined by FLR 3.12 as a person who does not understand the nature and possible consequences of the proceeding or is not capable of adequately conducting, or giving adequate instruction for the conduct of, the proceeding. An adult with no adverse interest who can fairly and competently conduct the case for that person may be such a guardian (FLR 3.14; in WA, FCR 104). The court may appoint, replace or remove such a guardian under FLR 3.15 (in WA, FCR 105). Keyes [2009] FMCAfam 347 at [20]-[31] contains a discussion of the law relating to the appointment of a litigation guardian. For the removal of one, see Eastman & Pellis [2021] FCCA 1358. What to file? • Application (or Response) seeking the appointment (see below) • Affidavit of the proposed appointee (see precedent below) Notice of appointment to be given to other parties: FLR 3.17 (in WA, FCR 107). For an order for a litigation guardian’s costs see FLR 3.18 (in WA, FCR 108). For service on a person with a disability see FLR 2.37 (in WA, FCR 127). For a litigation guardian’s duties, see FLR 3.13 (in WA, cf. FCR 109).

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 44 APPEALS Introduction Appeals are governed by Chapter 13 of the FLR. A party may bring an appeal from an order of a court by filing a Notice of Appeal within 28 days after the date of the order: 13.02 and 13.03 (in WA, FCR 452, 453). See the FCFCA’s brochure “Family Law: Appeals”. A Notice of Appeal is here at our eBook or at “forms & precedents”. Filing fee on Notice of Appeal: $1,665. That fee also applies to an application for leave to appeal. These fees are now increased annually on 1 July every year. See “court fees” for FCFCA and FCWA. An appeal is not a re-hearing but must be on a point of law (except for an appeal from a court of sum- mary jurisdiction, as to which see s 47A FLA). A respondent may argue that the decision below should be varied or set aside by filing a Notice of Appeal endorsed as a cross-appeal: FLR 13.07 (in WA, FCR 456). A copy of a Notice of Appeal must be served on each other party within 14 days after it is filed: FLR 13.05 (in WA, FCR 455). As to an application to extend time see June & Romano [2011] FamCAFC 31 at [4]. An appellant must file a draft index to the appeal books within 28 days after filing the Notice of Appeal: FLR 13.14 (cf. FCR 464). A Notice of Appeal may be amended without leave at any time up to and including the date fixed for the procedural hearing for the appeal: FLR 13.10 (in WA, FCR 458).

The Full Court at [21] said: “Referring to whether the refusal of a stay would render a successful appeal nugatory or make it impossible or impracticable to restore the position, he concluded that it would be likely to be more difficult to re-establish the existing warm and significant attachment between the respondent and the child if it was ended or significantly limited rather than if it was allowed to continue as he had proposed.” A limited stay of part of an interim parenting order has been granted due to a mother’s distress (which, the court accepted, would become apparent to",

If an application for special leave to appeal would be futile unless a stay is granted, the jurisdiction arises.” (Jennings Construction Ltd v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd (No 1) [1986] HCA 84 at [3] per Brennan J, who at [5] described a stay to preserve the litigation’s subject matter as “an extraordinary jurisdiction”, and that “exceptional circumstances must be shown before its exercise is warranted”). In Jackson & Balen [2009] FamCAFC 131 at [28] the Full Court said: “The principles to be applied in hearing a stay application pending an appeal are well settled [cases cited]. Those authorities stress the discretionary nature of the application which should be determined on its merits. Principles relevant to this matter include the following: • the onus to establish a proper basis for the stay is on the applicant for the stay. However it is not necessary for the applicant to demonstrate any ‘special’ or ‘exceptional’ circumstances; • a person who has obtained a judgment is entitled to the benefit of that judgment; • a person who has obtained a judgment is entitled to presume the judgment is correct; • the mere filing of an appeal is insufficient to grant a stay; • the application must be bona fides; • a stay may be granted on terms that are fair to all parties - this may involve a court weighing the balance of convenience and the competing rights of the parties; • a weighing of the risk that an appeal may be rendered nugatory if a stay",

      "text": "OTHER ROUTINE PROCEDURES 8 – 47 COSTS AND SECURITY FOR COSTS Parties to proceedings under the Family Law Act are usually ordered to pay their own costs, according to the general rule to that effect contained in s 117(1). An order for costs may be made if the court finds that there are circumstances justifying the making of such an order: s 117(2). The High Court said in Penfold [1980] HCA 4 at [13]: “Sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. Beyond this there is … [no] additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs. Consequently … we do not agree with the suggestion … that an order can only be made under s 117(2) in ‘a clear case’.” The factors relevant to whether a costs order should be made are set out in s 117(2A): a) the financial circumstances of each party; b) whether a party has legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant; c) the conduct of the parties as to particulars, discovery of documents and such matters; d) whether non-compliance with previous orders necessitated the proceedings; e) whether any party has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings (Marvis [2023] FedCFamC1A 34 at [17]-[25]); f) the terms of any written offer to settle (Firmer & Britton [2012] FamCA 576; Petruski & Balewa [2013] FamCAFC 15 at [31]; 80% of costs awarded due to a maintenance claim being opposed in Bronson (No. 2) [2012] FamCA 676; indemnity costs awarded for “enormous” difference between offer and outcome in Lad & Gittins [2014] FamCA 439; but in Paradin [2020] FamCAFC 245 a costs order was set aside as W’s offer did not conclude all matters in issue); and g) such other matters as",

For a useful review of each factor see Parker & Jacks (No. 3) [2009] FMCAfam 993 at [29]-[53]. A costs application is made under FLR 12.13 (in WA, FCR 331).

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 48 Other costs provisions • False statements. Section 117AB (which made mandatory a costs order against a party who “know- ingly made a false allegation or statement in the proceedings”) was repealed on 7 June 2012 by the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Act 2011 for the purpose (according to [79] of the Explanatory Memorandum) of removing a provision that had “operated as a disincentive” to the disclosure by “vulnerable parents” of “legitimate safety concerns”. Given that s 117AB was not repealed for being bad law and that the Explanatory Memorandum noted that “s 117 … will allow family courts to make cost orders in response to false statements in appropriate cases” a cost order, while now discretionary, should arguably be granted in such cases, under s 117(2). The following case law should be relevant to the type of conduct that hitherto attracted a mandatory costs order. Also rely on Colgate (above) for indemnity costs for “false state- ments knowingly made”. A false denial is intended to be included: Charles [2007] FamCA 276 at [30]. See Penfold (above) at [16] of the majority judgment and [4] of Murphy J’s judgment; also Parker & Jacks (No. 3) (above) at [54]-[68] and Garrod & Davenort [2021] FamCA 276. In Charles (above) at [24] Cronin J said: “For a Court to be satisfied that a person knowingly made a false allegation or statement in the proceedings must mean that a Court could be comfortable in finding that the person lied. (…) The finding must be elevated above the ‘probable’ level set out in s 140(1) of the Evidence Act 1995…That is, the Briginshaw test [a finding beyond reasonable doubt] applies.” • Costs may be awarded in vexatious proceedings (s 102QB(2)(c)); against a party who fails",

It was also considered that he did have a potential claim against her for costs if her application failed, which would be unlikely to be met (the wife alleging that “she had no money”) without such an order being made. The Court (at [59]-[63]) said: “…it is necessary to establish that there are justifying circumstances.

Subsection (2) not being limited to “parties” (as subsection (1) is) a costs order may be made against a non-party, e.g. a solicitor: Z (a solicitor) & Limousin [2010] FamCAFC 59.

In Dwyer & Brent & Anor [2010] FMCAfam 1224 at [9] and [18] a lawyer was ordered to pay costs having regard to “the way the case [was] conducted” (the filing of an inappropriate Notice of Risk of Family Violence).

      "text": "OTHER ROUTINE PROCEDURES 8 – 53 CONFLICT OF INTEREST The law was summarised by the Full Court in Osferatu [2015] FamCAFC 177 at [20]-[26] as follows: “There are three established categories on the basis of which solicitors may be restrained from acting against their client or former client. They are: breach of confidence, breach of fiduciary duty and the inherent jurisdiction of a court over its officers and to control its process. Each cat- egory has its own principles which guide its operation. ( … ) The case before the trial judge was only concerned with the first category: the risk of the misuse of confidential information and we thus confine ourselves to it. The manner in which a client’s confidential information is to be protected in family law proceed- ings was clearly explained by the Full Court in McMillan & McMillan [2000] FamCA 1046 where the Full Court … reviewed … authorities in the Family Court and in … other courts. The follow- ing statement of Frederico J in Thevenaz & Thevenaz [1986] FamCA 44 [at [15]] was expressly adopted by the court: ‘Thus “a practitioner who wishes to cease acting for one party and to continue to act for the other party will be restrained from doing so by the court if there is any evidence that confidential communications have been made to him by the party for whom he is ceasing to act. In such a case the court will not weigh conflicting evidence as to confidence. It will act upon the evidence of the client who swears that he has made the confidential commu- nication”. (Reference omitted).’ The following passage from Thevenaz was also expressly adopted by the Full Court in McMillan: ‘It is my view that in this case [the lawyer] should not continue to",

      "text": "It will act upon the evidence of the client who swears that he has made the confidential commu- nication”. (Reference omitted).’ The following passage from Thevenaz was also expressly adopted by the Full Court in McMillan: ‘It is my view that in this case [the lawyer] should not continue to act on behalf of [the wife]. It may well be that the risks were he to do so are more theoretical than practical. How- ever, it is asserted and not contradicted that material in the files does relate to confidences exchanged in the course of the former firm previously acting on behalf of both parties and would embarrass the husband. It is of the utmost importance that justice should not only be done but should appear to be done. In the circumstances of the present case, there is a risk which may well be merely theoretical but still exists, that justice might not appear to be done. In S & S (Unrep) (“Stewart”) [1997] FamCA 65 Lindenmayer J said: ‘ ... All that is necessary is that the wife swears that she has conveyed confidential informa- tion to the solicitors and that she believes, not unreasonably, that that information may be used against her, or at least to her disadvantage, in these current proceedings...’ Of that passage the Full Court in McMillan said at [87]: ‘In other words, the client need only give evidence that he has provided confidential infor- mation to the solicitor (or in this case, the law clerk/secretary). The client does not have to divulge the content of that information. ( … )’ It is, however, important to recognise that McMillan, as were Thevenaz and Stewart, was a case where the applicant was seeking to restrain a solicitor or a clerk to whom they had recently, and",

Because the applicants in those cases had given instructions to the solicitor about the very matter in issue, it follows easily that there would be a finding that the solicitor who had moved was in possession of confidential information which is or may be relevant to that matter.

      "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT 8 – 54 ‘All that is necessary is that ...’. His Honour was simply saying that, in such circumstances, the burden borne by the applicant was discharged by such evidence. Nothing that appears in Stew- art, Thevenaz or McMillan obviates the need for an applicant seeking such relief from discharg- ing his/her burden of proof by adducing cogent and persuasive evidence. This is particularly so where, as here, the circumstances differ from McMillan. In this case Mr F had never taken instruc- tions from the wife.” The Full Court concluded (at [48]): “ … for evidence to be persuasive and cogent [the wife] should have identified the nature of the information received or likely to have been received by Mr F … that was now, or could now be, relevant to the current proceedings. She did not do so. It is not sufficient to say that, as family law proceedings cover a range of matters, any information at all received by Mr F could have been relevant. This was especially so given that three years had passed since he could have received any information and both sets of substantive proceedings … had resolved.” It was also held that the court below erred in giving no reasons as to why the wife’s email to the husband (waiving objection) did not carry significant weight. Effect of delay in objecting In McGillivray & Mitchell [1998] FamCA 96 at para 36 the Full Court said this: “It is our opinion that if a family law litigant has a genuine concern about a former legal adviser acting against him or her in later family law litigation, the litigant must take the point at least in correspondence with the other side at the earliest possible opportunity.

A litigant in person (LIP) requires procedural fairness. A LIP may be experiencing stress … , desperation, anger, fear, anxiety or bitterness and may be suspicious of the independence of judges and lawyers ( … thinking there is collusion between the two). So be patient and adaptable. Maintain a professional and courteous demeanour … Avoid [appearing to be] too friendly with a judge or registrar and speak- ing in legalese. Keep in mind that your client will suffer if a judgment or consent order can be set aside on appeal for procedural unfairness to the LIP. Be familiar with Re F below and be aware of and take steps to avoid the risk, by your dealings with a LIP, of becoming a witness in the case. “Litigants in person – A counsel’s perspective” (2014) by Lindsay Ellison SC of the NSW bar “Litigants in person” (2015) by Tony Allen barrister of the NSW bar Acting against a litigant in person 1. Further to the above, avoid giving legal advice to or making submissions for a LIP but correct any blatant misstatement of law or fact and any concession by a LIP that is wrongly made. Volunteer information favourable to a LIP’s case if not doing so would mean that a court would form an er- roneous view of the evidence or the law. 2. Comply with your own State’s or Territory’s rules of conduct. 3. Remind a LIP of the rules as to alternative dispute resolution.",

Upon a LIP’s non-compliance with directions or an order require them in writing to comply (so as to avoid an application by you and costs). 7. Remind anyone for whom you cease to act of the need to comply with any undertakings. 8. Tell a LIP that any settlement negotiations must not be repeated.

Doing so may expose you to liability for any advice grounded on inaccurate, false or incomplete information. 2. In some States lawyers may limit their liability by certain wording in client engagement letters. Even without such legislation you may limit your liability by defining in writing the work you have been asked to carry out and the information you require before it is carried out. Don’t sign an Application for Consent Orders without sufficient information. 3. As a lawyer will not usually be able totally to control the limits set on their involvement these liability issues need to be anticipated in any retainer agreement. Such an agreement should provide for termination immediately upon completion of the task for which you were engaged.

      "text": "CHAPTER NINE 9 – 2 INTRODUCTION Financial agreements were introduced on 27 December 2000 as a means of enabling couples to opt out of the court’s jurisdiction to deal with property and spousal maintenance under Part VIII of the Family Law Act. A new Part VIIIA was inserted, enabling financial agreements: • before marriage (s 90B) (known as “pre-nuptial agreements”) • during marriage (s 90C) (whether or not the parties are separated) • after divorce (s 90D) Couples have the option of either entering into such contracts, or not doing so out of preference for less formal financial arrangements should the need (any separation) ever arise – and when the parties’ means and needs will be known. Such informal arrangements can be by way of the parties reaching agreement, then filing an application for consent orders; or negotiating a settlement after applying to the FCFCA or FCWA for property and/or spousal maintenance orders. The jurisdiction of the court ceases to apply once a financial agreement is made (s 71A). The court does, however, retain its power to set aside such an agreement (s 90K). THE DE FACTO AMENDMENT The Part VIIIAB “de facto amendment” of the FLA introduced on 1 March 2009 includes Division 4, which mirrors Part VIIIA of the Act, so as to make financial agreements available to de facto partners. • Agreements between future, current and ex-de facto partners are called “Part VIIIAB financial agreements”: ss 90UB, UC and UD • These agreements can only be made if the de facto couple are ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction: s 90UA • Part VIIIAB agreements cannot be made if a de facto relationship broke down before 1 March 2009 (1 July 2010 in SA) unless the parties opt-in to the new regime: ss86 and 86A of Part",

A pre-marital agreement is an open-ended contract that may extend for 50 years or more and it is impossible for the parties to envisage what may happen over that period. It seems unlikely that many couples will avail themselves of the option of entering into an agreement during the marriage while their relationship remains a happy one. In the case of violent or abusive marriages there may be extreme pressure to enter into such an agreement and I doubt that the provision for independent advice is likely to overcome such pressure. At the same time, proof of duress in such cases is notoriously difficult. (…) Many lawyers are not expert in",

The equivalent sec- tions are ss 90UB (for s 90B), 90UC (for s 90C), 90UD (for s 90D), 90UF and UG (for s 90DA), 90UH (for s 90E), 90UI (for s 90F), and 90UJ (for s 90G). The Full Court in Black [2008] FamCAFC 7 set aside a financial agreement for not containing a statement acknowledging that the parties had received independent legal advice as required by s 90G(1)(b) (above). The Act, however, was amended on 4 January 2010 as to s 90G as above, (1A) being added to empower the court to declare a financial (or termination) agreement to be binding despite: • each party not having been provided with the required advice; or • in respect of post-4/1/10 agreements – each party not having been provided with a signed statement by a legal practitioner as to the advice provided to them, or given a copy of the other’s party’s lawyer’s statement; if the court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made). This amendment extends to Part VIIIAB agreements. The Full Court held in Parker [2012] FamCAFC 33 that ss 90G(1A), (1B) and (1C) should be construed liberally (“whether as to ‘technicality’ or otherwise” being added by Murphy J, in dissent but where a view was not expressed by the",

We recommend • That although an agreement no longer needs (a) to state that the parties received independent advice or (b) a lawyer’s statement to be annexed, we recommend as good practice that you con- tinue preparing agreements that do both (as per our precedents, which we will keep as they are). • That you make sure a photocopy of the original of your (lawyer’s) statement is provided to your client (before or after the agreement is signed) and also given to the other party or their lawyer before you archive the original.

HOW TO TAKE INSTRUCTIONS IN RELATION TO A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT Despite the importance of consensus between parties as to what they want, it is advisable to take instructions from one party only so that the parties each consult their own lawyer independently. If you draft an agreement after seeing the parties together, you would have to refer each of them to a second lawyer for the requisite independent advice (and a conflict of interest would then prevent you from representing either party in any contentious marital matter later). When a party asks you about having an agreement, they are in need of your advice. Avoid jumping in and necessarily recommending one. Your basic roles are to: • advise as to the effect of the agreement on their rights and the advantages and disadvantages to them of entering into it (in accordance with the certificate you will sign) • advise against a financial agreement if that is your advice (whichever party you act for), and say so in a written advice to your client with your reasons for that advice • provide legal advice so that your client can make an informed decision whether or not to enter into the agreement (see Parker [2010] FamCA 664 at [113]-[114] per Strickland J, set aside on appeal – see “strict compliance no longer necessary” above), your role not being to refuse to prepare or witness a financial agreement or refuse to sign a statement of",

      "text": "FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS 9 – 7 DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN WHICH YOUR SERVICES MAY BE SOUGHT Our approach becomes clearer if we recognise the different circumstances in which our services will usually be required: A one-sided unilateral quarantine – Scenario 1 You are consulted by a person wanting a pre-marital agreement to quarantine his or her entire wealth, for the sole or primary purpose of securing that wealth against claim by the other party, without any particular thought being given to that party’s future needs. The unilateral quarantine of one party’s existing property – especially when accompanied by a (usually equal) division of the couple’s future assets – is where problems can arise for both parties. For examples of what can occur behind the scenes for the other party to end up “agreeing” to sign such agreements see Jacobs & Vale [2008] FMCAfam 641 (“unjust enrichment” below) or the more extreme case of G & G [2000] FamCA 1075 before the Full Court (“undue influence” below). You will find that the initiating party will expect the agreement you prepare to be and remain binding regardless of what their partner’s future needs might be. It is important here (if only in terms of your liability) to manage that expectation. Advise your client of the advantages and disadvantages of financial agreements as set out below, including the circumstances in which they can be set aside. Consider whether it is even within the scope of your draftsmanship to protect your agreement from future challenge.

I did not intend to renew my builder’s licence as I was only supervising the construction. (Ms Vale) and I agreed that it would take approximately two months to produce the conceptual design and approximately ten months to supervise the construction. We estimated that it would take 100 hours for the design process and 500 hours for the supervision. At a rate of $50 an hour over 600 hours, this equates to $30,000. This is the figure we used for the compensation payment in the agreement. As it happened, however, I had to leave full time employment and take on the responsibility for the construction of our home to the extent that neither of us had foreseen when entering into the BFA on the 7 October 2002.” The wife’s application for summary dismissal was dismissed and the husband was allowed to continue with his claim for a property settlement in the order of $380,000. Comment Many of the insidious aspects of unilateral agreements (allegedly) occurred there – manipulation, marriage having its “price”, ultimatum, subjugation (and even, some time later, unforeseen hardship) – and are typical of the kind of pressure that is often brought to bear in the lead up to the signing of such agreements – quite often just days before the wedding (see G & G at “undue influence” below). It makes for uncomfortable reading to see allegations of a loving partner being worked on – initial resistance, then acquiescence, (short-lived) bravado (“what’s yours is yours”), retraction of consent and then, ultimately, resignation.

For an example of the more usual case of a future wife being caught in an unequal relationship see G & G below under “undue influence”. Many Scenario 1 agreements will recite mutuality of quarantine, which you know is not true as soon as you are given the respective schedules of assets. Unilateral agreements that go on to make all future assets jointly owned compound the disadvantage of the weaker party who in the absence of such a provision would be rightly entitled to an unequal adjust- ment of property in their favour. There is also much extreme draftsmanship in circulation, with its sliding scale of annual percentages or amounts; guaranteed sums or percentage of total assets; fixed maximum amounts; a deal to pay out a mortgage after X years etc, so as to anticipate the parties’ future needs and means, allocate an appropriate settlement and hope that it holds up. Avoid this – noting what Nicholson CJ had to say (above) about long-term pre-marital agreements.

This is the purest form of client consultation where a financial agreement makes sense to everyone – real agreement. They are set out below under “when a financial agreement may be appropriate” and may be summarised as: • Mutual quarantine of assets • Unilateral quarantine of a special asset • Release of spousal maintenance in exchange for a satisfactory property settlement Note – We discuss a fourth type of financial agreement, being a mutual quarantine of existing assets with provision also made for future assets, for couples late in their relationship with no children. THE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS WITH FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS A client seeing you for the first time about a financial agreement should be informed that the main problems with such agreements are that: • they can either be impossible for the financially weaker party to get out of in the event of later hardship, where there are no children to each other and none intended; or • where children are or might be involved, can require constant (and tedious) re-doing, so as not to risk being set aside for a party’s hardship due to a change in circumstances relating to a child (this being a problem for the financially stronger party expecting the agreement to be “binding”) Consider this from our poll: Question: In the 8 years since their inception, how many of your financial agreements (1–2 a month) have been updated by later financial agreements? Answer: A handful. Some agreements recite that the parties “will review the agreement” if a child comes along and the mother forgoes employment to care for the child, but that will",

Some agreements recite that the parties “will review the agreement” if a child comes along and the mother forgoes employment to care for the child, but that will not go far enough without a clause revoking the agreement (requiring them to negotiate and make a fresh agreement in light of the new financial circumstances of the parties). Even if you were to program the sending of, say, annual client reminders of the need to renew financial agreements as circumstances change, could you possibly ensure that they did so? Or would they begin resenting your “interference in their lives”, perhaps even doubting your competence (“why couldn’t all this have been sorted out to start with”)?

Answer: No. • An inappropriate financial agreement – whether it binds a financially weaker client to a deal of which she/he later complains or gives, say, the wife of your financially stronger client a loophole of which he later complains – can have implications for your own liability Consider this from the poll: Question: What proportion of your financial agreements remain untested by the court because the parties are still together?

However, as one of our subscribers has pointed out, “the facts of that case contributed to the court find- ing the agreement to be enforceable. The agreement was signed towards what was ultimately the end of the relationship, not at the beginning, and there were no children of the relationship. Would the court view a pre-nuptial agreement, similar to Cording entered into by a couple at the begin- ning of their relationship who go on to have a long relationship and children, as enforceable? That remains to be seen.” In the first two cases it should be sufficient to confine the agreement to a simple quarantine of the relevant assets; leaving",

That remains to be seen.” In the first two cases it should be sufficient to confine the agreement to a simple quarantine of the relevant assets; leaving division of all other and future assets to be as agreed informally or by follow- ing the FCFCA’s pre-action procedures (Part 1, Schedule 1 of the FLR) or resolved by court proceedings under Part VIII as a last resort. Section 90K (grounds for setting aside an agreement) was put there for the protection of the vulnerable or disadvantaged. Neither party could reasonably object to the court having a role in applying such safeguards should the making or application of an agreement be properly called into question. Nor should we shy away from the court’s jurisdiction under Part VIII of the Family Law Act, ss 79 and 75(2) being two of the most durable – least amended – sections of the Act. The Court’s pre-action procedures may be adopted in your Agreement as a non-adversarial means of resolution. This kind of structure offers both a consensual financial arrangement and independence from the court in the resolution of any dispute. Identifying a proper and limited basis for a financial agreement will lend itself to simple expression. If you keep the agreement simple, the parties will understand it and make sense of it.

I am satisfied that he know- ingly made that representation to Mrs Adame. I am satisfied that he intended that she rely on that representation. ( … ) I am satisfied that Mrs Adame relied upon Mr Adame’s statement set out in Recital J of the financial agreement (… ) In those circumstances the financial agreement was void- able at Mrs Adame’s election.” “Void, voidable or unenforceable” Under common law and equity a court may hold an agreement to be voidable by a party or unenforce- able on such grounds as duress, undue influence, unjust enrichment and unconscionability (the last of those also being a separate ground under s 90K",

An agreement was held in Adame (above) to be voidable at the wife’s election for the husband’s misrepresentation of his assets. It was also found that the wife had signed the agreement under duress ([138]-[146]). Duress ‘Duress…need [not]…involve a direct threat of physical violence so long as there is sufficient oppres- sion…to vitiate the reality of…consent.’: Teves & Campomayor [1994] FamCA 57 applied in Robert & Golden [2011] FamCA 443.

      "text": "CHAPTER NINE 9 – 16 The couple in their 70s had had a close friendship for 13 years. The court heard evidence ([16]) that the parties had discussed marriage. The wife’s evidence was: “After his mother’s death we spoke on a number of occasions regarding marriage. I would say…`Why don’t we get married?’ He would say…`In time’. Later he would say… `I will marry you if you sign a Pre-Marital Agreement’. I felt that he either wanted to marry me or not and that such an Agreement was not necessary. On such occasions I said to him… `I do not want to sign a Pre-Marital Agreement’. The husband would say… `I am not going to marry you unless you sign it.’ After a considerable period of time I relented and that Agreement was signed.’’ After noting, at [22], that the agreement had been entered into on legal advice, Nicholson CJ, at [23] and [24], referred to the trial judge saying this about the wife: “I have some doubts about the circumstances under which the wife entered into the agreement, and whether her agreement was truly voluntary and the husband’s actual understanding of the effect of the agreement. ( … ) I find the wife relented to sign the agreement because after a 13 year relationship she wished to have the parties’ relationship formalised. She was no doubt in a position of vulnerability because of the uncertainty of her status, and I find there was inequality in her bargaining position with the husband who unilaterally imposed his condition precedent on the wife prior to the marriage.” His Honour, at [26], then referred to these further remarks of the trial judge, Boland J: “The agreement may have been considered to make a just and equitable provision for the wife at the time",

It may have seemed in fact generous to the wife if the marriage had only lasted a short time or it may have in fact reflected the past contributions made by the wife over the parties’ preceding 13 year relationship. However, it contained no provision to increase the wife’s entitlements to recognise long term contributions she may make to the marriage, for example, if the husband suffered illness and she provided substantial nursing services to him or the marriage endured for many years. The agreement did not contemplate the circumstances as have occurred in this case that the wife’s assets may diminish, that she may suffer ill health requiring domestic assistance and that she could be dependant on the aged pension to meet her daily living expenses. In these circumstances the provisions and particularly having regard to her contributions during the marriage cannot now be regarded as just and equitable.” For a discussion of the case law on undue influence see Thorne v Kennedy [2017] HCA 49 at [30]-[36]; also [1]-[2] and [54]-[60] of the majority judgment.

      "text": "FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS 9 – 17 Jarrett FM, at [29], referred to “Mr Jacobs’ claim that Ms Vale would be ‘unjustly enriched’ by the con- tributions made by him”, and cited David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1992] HCA 48 in which the High Court at [46] said: “…the law recognises, in a variety of distinct categories of case, an obligation on the part of a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff ( … ) (but) it is not legitimate to determine whether an enrichment is unjust by reference to some subjective evaluation of what is fair or unconscionable. Instead, recovery depends upon the existence of a qualifying or vitiating factor such as mistake, duress or illegality.” Example The High Court in David Securities continued at [46]: “In other words, receipt of a payment which has been made under a fundamental mistake is one of the categories of case in which the facts give rise to a prima facie obligation to make restitution, in the sense of compensation for the benefit of unjust enrichment, to the person who has sustained the countervailing detriment.” Note – Jarrett FM was not required to determine the merits of the husband’s claim that the financial agreement should be set aside, the case being confined to whether he had an arguable case (the Court holding that he did). “Impracticable for the agreement to be carried out” A husband’s application to set aside an order transferring a business to him because a downturn had reduced its value was dismissed in La Rocca [1991] FamCA 97 by Kay J who said: “My own view is that the concept of impracticability…is akin to the application of the doctrine of frustration in contractual matters.

Whatever the financial situation of an applicant may be, his or her loss of a prospective entitlement to property including money, or his or her inability to have the financial and property relations of the parties adjusted or resolved, may constitute hardship.” “Hardship” has been construed as “substantial detriment”: Whitford (above) at [32]. “Unconscionable conduct (in the making of the agreement)” Unconscionable conduct was considered in the High Court case of Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio [1983] HCA 14 by Deane J who at [13] of his judgment said: “Unconscionable dealing looks to the conduct of the stronger party in attempting to enforce, or retain the benefit of, a dealing with a person under a special disability in circumstances where it is not consistent with equity or good conscience that he should do so.” His Honour further explained this principle in Louth v Diprose [1992] HCA 61 at [11]: “It has long been established that the jurisdiction of courts of equity to relieve against unconscionable dealing extends generally to circumstances in which (i) a party to a transaction was under a special disability in dealing with the other party to the transaction with the consequence that there was an absence of any reasonable degree of equality between them and (ii) that special disability was sufficiently evident to the other party to make it prima facie unfair or ‘unconscionable’ that that other party procure, accept or retain the benefit of, the disadvantaged party’s assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he or she procured or accepted it.” Examples",

Purpose of the Agreement The purpose of the Agreement is (delete the following purposes that do not apply): • Mutual quarantine of assets – to enable both parties for the future benefit of children of a previous marriage or relationship (or other intended beneficiary) to preserve certain assets of theirs from future claim by the other, and limit the agreement to such property OR • Unilateral quarantine – to enable one party for the future benefit of children of a previous mar- riage or relationship (or other intended beneficiary) to preserve from future claim by the other certain assets, and limit the agreement to that purpose OR • Release of maintenance – (after separation) for the agreement to be a release from future spousal maintenance in exchange for a satisfactory property settlement, as a “clean break” from each other financially Effect of the Agreement on your rights This Agreement means that one party will be giving up their right to include in the “asset pool” in any future property claim any asset being quarantined by the other party. There is a clause by which such an asset either may or may not be taken into account (as a financial resource of the party who owns it) in any future court proceedings for property settlement, in favour of the financially weaker party. It is for you both to agree upon this in the agreement as to whether or not a quarantined asset may be indirectly taken into account in that way. An agreement solely operating as a release of maintenance will prevent any such claim being made in the",

An agreement solely operating as a release of maintenance will prevent any such claim being made in the future, so a party agreeing to waive any further claim to maintenance should only do so as part of a satisfactory property and/or spousal or de facto partner maintenance settlement. Could the Agreement be set aside by the court? Yes if there has been fraud (such as non-disclosure of a material matter); an intention to defeat or reckless disregard of the interests of a creditor; any duress, undue influence or unconscionable conduct (taking advantage of any weakness of a party); or circumstances have arisen making it imprac- ticable for the Agreement to be carried out; or where the care arrangements for a child of the parties have materially changed so that a party will suffer hardship if the Agreement is not set aside. If the Agreement includes a third party an intention to defraud, or defeat the property interests of that third party or the reckless disregard of those interests are grounds for the Agreement being set aside. An agreement operating as a release of maintenance will be of no effect if, at separation (confirmed by the signing of a separation declaration attached to the agreement), a party is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

Other grounds to set aside an agreement are where any superannuation has a “payment flag” operating or is an “unsplittable interest”.] Advantages of making the Agreement • The Agreement will implement your joint purpose, as set out above • In the case of a quarantine of assets, it will leave all other assets available for any future property settlement negotiations or proceedings in court Disadvantages of making the Agreement • If you have no children to each other and intend having none, the Agreement will remain legally binding despite any unexpected worsening of a party’s financial circumstances (such as loss of job; failure of a business; serious injury) • The Agreement could be set aside in the event of a material change of circumstances relating to a child of the marriage as a result of which a party will suffer hardship if the court does not set the agreement aside Note – A clause terminating the Agreement upon or within a certain time after the birth of a child (requiring you to negotiate a fresh agreement) could guard against that. • A unilateral quarantine of all or most of one party’s assets is likely to produce for the other party a worse ultimate outcome than could otherwise be expected in any later court proceedings Should we each make or have wills? Yes. The Agreement will apply in the event of the death of either party, so long as both of you make or have wills now that are consistent with its terms.

As to property issues, we recommend that you use consent orders (filed at the same time as the financial agreement is made). We do so because a property order is generally harder to set aside (under the lesser scope of s 79A) than a financial agreement (which runs the gauntlet of ss 90G, 90K and 90KA) and for stamp duty reasons too. In Queensland, for example, the identity of the transferee under an order is irrelevant for stamp duty exemption whereas OSR (Qld) guidelines for transfers under a finan- cial agreement require stamp duty to be paid by a non-spouse transferee.

Although this amendment was incorporated into our June quarter 2009 update of , we have kept this summary here as a quick reference to its key points. FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) ACT 2008 Introduction On 1 March 2009 the Family Law Act was amended to provide for financial matters arising out of the breakdown of de facto relationships and other measures. Schedule 1 of the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008 applies to all States and Territories except WA, which has not referred its power to deal with such matters to the Commonwealth. SA referred its power on 1 July 2010. Exclusive jurisdiction in de facto financial causes Except in WA, State and Territory laws do not apply to financial matters between parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of the amendment, being 1 March 2009 (1 July 2010 in SA upon its referral of power): Exception – insufficient link to a participating jurisdiction or Division 2 not applicable because of s 90SB (see below). Section 90RC(3) offers the following example: “Cleo and Dan are parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of this section. Early in their relationship, they made a financial agreement under the law of a non referring State, but later spent most of their relationship in a participating jurisdiction. Cleo and Dan now have a sufficient geographical link with a participating jurisdiction for either",

This means that subsection (3) will not apply and that their financial agreement will not be enforceable under State law because of subsection (2).

      "text": "ADDENDUM A – 4 PART VIIIAB – FINANCIAL MATTERS RELATING TO DE FACTO RELATIONSHIPS Editor’s note This amendment – bringing the financial rights of de facto couples on to the same footing as those of married couples – was achieved not by the strategic amendment of Parts VIII (maintenance and property) and VIIIA (financial agreements) but by inserting yet another part to the Family Law Act, which then largely mirrors those Parts. More seamless change did occur for Part VIIIB (s 90XC being amended to extend super splitting to de facto couples), and for s 4(1) definitions, Part V (jurisdiction) and Part VIIIAA (orders against third parties, using a cross-referencing schedule in s 90TA). The purpose of being to contain family law within one volume, this 100 page amendment has not been given its own chapter but instead has been integrated into our Chapters 6 (maintenance), 7 (property) and 9 (financial agreements), and all incidental matters of significance incorporated in the relevant chapter. The new Part VIIIAB largely mirrors the Act’s existing sections as to maintenance, property and financial agreements, and also provides for a declaration to be made about the existence of a de facto relation- ship (likely to be a popular preliminary issue for determination as to the application of Part VIIIAB). The layout of Part VIIIAB (with the mirror existing sections in brackets) is as follows: Division 1 Preliminary Sections 90RA and RB Definitions Section 90RC Relationship with State and Territory laws Sections 90RD-90RH Declaration about existence of de facto relationship Division 2 Maintenance and property Section 90SA Division excluded by financial agreement (s 71A) Section 90SB Circumstances where Division applies Section 90SC Division ceases to apply upon marriage Section 90SD Maintenance – geographical requirement (s 39) Section 90SE Power of court in maintenance proceedings (s 74)",

      "text": "ADDENDUM A – 7 Threshold declaration about existence of de facto relationship One major point of difference between married and unmarried parties is that jurisdiction rarely troubles domiciled spouse applicants. They need only prove the marriage, and they do so by filing the marriage certificate. The existence of a de facto relationship, however, is an arguable question of fact which can make or break the right to apply. Section 90RD(1) enables a declaration to be made by the court that a de facto relationship existed, or never existed, between the parties. See Moby & Schulter [2010] FamCA 748 at paras 126-142 and Jonah & White [2011] FamCA 221 at paras 34-67. Under s 90RD(2) such a declaration may also declare any or all of the following: a) the period or periods of the relationship (as to s 90SB(a) above) b) whether there is a child of the relationship c) whether a party made substantial contributions under s 90SM(4)(a)–(c): see Miller & Trent [2011] FMCAfam 324 at paras 32, 53-64, 86-88 and 103 d) when the relationship ended (after 1 March 2009 – 1 July 2010 in SA – to be eligible) e) where each party was ordinarily resident during the relationship Note – Your court application should seek such a declaration as an interim order and the ultimate orders sought as final orders. Such a declaration may be set aside for non-disclosure: s 90RH Maintenance and property proceedings – power of court and relevant factors The court’s powers and matters to be taken into account in your applications for de facto partner maintenance and property orders mirror existing sections of the Family Law Act.

Also introduced, for both types of agreement, is the awkward concept of the “spouse party” (i.e. a party to the agreement and to the contemplated, existing or former marriage or de facto relationship) and “third party” (party to agreement who is not a spouse party): s 4(1) Note – “Spouse parties” may enter into a financial agreement with “one or more other people” (ss 90UB(1), 90UC(1) and 90UD(1)). This facility stems from the extension of a “de facto relationship” under s 4AA(5) to a case where one (or presumably both) of the partners are “legally married” to someone else or in another de facto relationship (in which a de facto couple might conceivably be involved in three marital or de facto relationships at once). Geographical requirement for Part VIIIAB agreements A Part VIIIAB financial agreement may be made by two or more people only if the spouse parties are ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when they make the agreement: s 90UA Types and formalities of Part VIIIAB agreements and other provisions These are the same as for financial agreements (Part VIIIA). See the table above. Agreements in non-referring States can become Part VIIIAB agreements Agreements validly made in a non-referring State with respect to maintenance, property or financial resources may be accepted as Part VIIIAB agreements if the parties’ circumstances later change by a move to a participating jurisdiction: s 90UE The section refers to the Amendment Act’s “Part 2 – Transitional provisions” of Schedule 1 which also deems agreements made under the law of a State that becomes a",

      "text": "ADDENDUM A – 22 DISCOUNT AND LIFE TABLES Judge Brewster explained in a property case, Tremayne & Steen [2014] FCCA 2188 at [45, footnote 2], when calculating W’s share in H’s superannuation as follows: “[T]he concept of discounting emerged from compensation law where a loss extending over a pe- riod of years had to be converted into a lump sum. If for example a person is to be compensated for a loss of a salary of $1,000 a week, or $52,000 a year, over a period of ten years this is not accurately represented by an award of $520,000. The reason is that this amount could be put in an interest bearing account and, if $1,000 were withdrawn each week, there would be money left over after ten years. On the other hand inflation would likely mean that the $1,000 a week salary would have increased over time. In 1981 the High Court in Todorovic v Waller [1981] HCA 72 … ruled that a discount rate of 3% should be applied. In the hypothetical case I have used one would calculate the sum that would be required which, if invested at 3% per annum, would allow $1,000 to be withdrawn each week and be exhausted after ten years. Whilst what I am about to say is an oversimplification the 3% was said to represent the ‘real’ rate of interest, that is the dif- ference historically between the rate of interest that could be earned in a secure fund and the rate of inflation. Whether or not this is still true is debatable given the Global Financial Crisis and the resulting low interest rates now applying.” Of the handful of family law (property, maintenance and child support) cases in which Todorovic v Waller was cited (just 6 according to AustLII’s LawCite",

Whether or not this is still true is debatable given the Global Financial Crisis and the resulting low interest rates now applying.” Of the handful of family law (property, maintenance and child support) cases in which Todorovic v Waller was cited (just 6 according to AustLII’s LawCite as at June 2015) a 3% discount was applied in all of them. An actuary’s opinion on this would nonetheless be advisable. Court’s approach to capitalisation No discount was applied by Bryant CFM in R & R (No. 1) [2002] FMCAfam 153 at page 5-33 above in the capitalisation of child support over 5 years. The court’s discretion in relation to lump sum and non-periodic child support under s 123 CSAA is gov- erned by what is under ss 123A and 124 CSAA “just and equitable” and “otherwise proper” (and the sum equaling or exceeding the annual rate of child support). In a spousal maintenance case, Brown [2007] FamCA 151 at [60]-[92] the Full Court held that capitali- sation does not necessarily require a mathematical approach, the assessment of lump sum maintenance being discretionary as to what is “proper” within the meaning of s 74(1) FLA both as to “the form of order and its quantum” ([58]). In an adult child maintenance case, Jamine and Anor (No. 2) [2011] FamCA 843 at [204]-[209] Cronin J awarded a sum capitalised over 9 years without discount. Adult child maintenance under s 66L FLA is determined by the standard of what the court considers “necessary to enable the child to complete his or her education or because of a mental or physical disability of the child”. In calculating a client’s s 75(2) factors in a property case such as disparity of income, the Full Court in Clauson [1995] FamCA 10 said that “it",

In calculating a client’s s 75(2) factors in a property case such as disparity of income, the Full Court in Clauson [1995] FamCA 10 said that “it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the criti- cal issue”. A capitalised costing of disparity (adding any other expectant future capital expense) would provide an evidentiary basis for the amount sought in accordance with Clauson, thus presenting a claim less easy for the other side (and the court) to dismiss or devalue. A percentage approach can allow a court to “talk up” a party’s future needs but award conservatively for those needs. Update 64 March 2025 quarter update",
